Gallery Show all 8 photos The Canadian automotive market has always been influenced by the United States. As our closest neighbour, naturally, many American products make it over the border. In the 1950s, however, Canada imposed a 35 per cent tariff on foreign vehicles, including those from the U.S. This resulted in U.S. manufacturers using Canadian-only brands to bypass these tariffs. These brands mostly consisted of badge-engineered models, or models made by one brand, and sold under a second brand as a different car. Most of these Canadian cars were already sold in the United States but were produced locally, with only a few minor changes. Because of this, Canada was host to a bunch of regionally exclusive cars that are now largely forgotten. Many of these brands ended following the introduction of the Auto Pact , which axed the import tariffs, and the U.S. brought more manufacturing to Canada. As a result, there was no longer a need for these odd Canadian brands because American models could be sold freely in the Canadian market. Meteor In the 1950s, Ford sold all its brands (Ford,",N,N,True

Gallery Show all 24 photos Sports cars can sometimes feel like gilded cages. High-performance vehicles’ enormous power and potential often serve as more of a reminder of the limits of civil commuting than a source of driving joy. Sure, a Porsche 911 can reach a top speed of 291 km/h, but it’s limited to the same effective top speed as a Toyota RAV4 on public roads. But at the Porsche Experience Centre (PEC) Toronto, drivers are handed the keys to a Porsche and to the lock on their gold-lined confines. The first Porsche Experience Centre in Canada, and only the 10 th globally, is located just outside of Toronto, in Ajax, Ont., and is part of the automaker’s ecosystem of driver engagement offerings that have been building since the first PEC opened in Silverstone, U.K., in 2008. Neither a racetrack nor dealership, the centre serves as a playground on which Porsche customers (and anyone with a moderately large stack of cash burning a hole in their pocket) can experience what the brand has to offer in a safe place that features a skid pad, a low-friction circuit, an open asphalt pad, and a 2-km track that features corners inspired by some ",N,N,True

Gallery Show all 6 photos The V12 engine is a rarity in the automotive world. Providing massive power along with enormous fuel bills, V12s are typically reserved for opulent luxury cars like Rolls-Royces or high-end performance cars like Ferraris. Sometimes, however, automakers go nuts and put large V12s in vehicles that just don’t make sense. 1. Volkswagen Touareg W12 While Volkswagen’s W12 engine is not truly a V12 in configuration, it has 12 cylinders, so we’ll go with it. The W12 was originally made for Volkswagen's failed flagship sedan, the Phaeton, which shared its platform with Audi and Bentley. Later, the W12 found a rather strange home in the Volkswagen Touareg SUV. While this decision sounds absurd, it makes sense in the automotive world of the 2000s because VW was trying to move upmarket to compete with BMW and Mercedes at the time. Offering such an opulent powertrain was bound to make some waves. The result was a Bentley-powered family SUV that produced 444 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. 2. Toyota Century V12 Toy",N,N,True

With a healthy dose of extra power, new aero elements, and improved driving dynamics, the new trim will be drifting into dealerships later this summer. The automaker turned to its racing division to make improvements to the M2’s 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. An extremely rigid crank case, a lightweight forged crankshaft, and a wire-arc sprayed iron coating in the cylinder bores — among other go-fast upgrades — all result in an engine that can pump out 523 hp, a 50 hp bump over the standard M2. The car also makes 479 lb-ft of torque between 2,700 and 5,620 rpm — that’s 36 lb-ft more than the non CS model, and it’s available over a wider portion of the rev range. That should make the M2 CS feel lightning quick and will make its power more readily available t",N,N,True

Gallery Show all 11 photos There’s no doubt about it: reviewing cars is a pretty cool gig. Sure, we can complain about jet lag (and get no sympathy), or whine about nutty schedules and brutal deadlines (no sympathy again), or try to convey the sad truth that when flying to cool exotic locales to drive expensive cars, we generally have barely enough time to drive the vehicle, take the pictures, and shoot video (no sympathy v3). And don’t get me started on motion sickness when riding shotgun through the mountains of Calabria in a Porsche. Yeah, I know. Boo-hoo. Get out the violins. Still, we here at AutoTrader take our responsibilities seriously, and for this writer, perhaps the best part of the job is sharing the wealth.

Originally established as an aircraft manufacturer, BMW released their first motorcycle, the R32, in 1923, and their first car, the Dixi 3/15, in 1928. Post-WWII, the company struggled to find their footing. The 1952 BMW 501 sedan helped the company regain its reputation for making exciting luxury vehicles. The 1961 BMW 1500, the first of the New Class line, turned BMW back into a profitable carmaker. The 1970s saw the launch of the BMW 3-Series, 5-Series and 7-Series, the success of which continues today. The BMW i3, the first all-electric BMW, launched in 2013, paving the way towards the company's growing selection of hybrid and electric models today.

If you’re considering buying a convertible, take a look below for our wide range of soft-top and hardtop convertibles. You’ll find plenty of new and used cars in your area that will let you take the top down and enjoy the sunshine. Size and style Convertibles range in size from small two-seat sports cars to compact or mid-size vehicles that offer 2+2 seating. Trunk space varies from fairly large to practically non-existent, and backseat leg-room can be very tight. You can also choose between soft-top and hideaway hardtop designs. Both top styles have advantages and disadvantages. For instance, a soft-top convertible does not provide much insulation from colder weather. Space and storage When buying a new convertible, consider your space and storage needs. If storage is important for you, a large trunk is essential. Remember that a convertible top has to go somewhere when it is retracted, and that can take up a good portion of the trunk area. A soft-top will generally use up less storage space than a retractable hardtop. Here are some top tips to consider when buying a convertible. Top tips: Determine your budget.

That means the station wagon offers greater fuel efficiency without sacrificing carrying capacity. A wagon hugs the road, which gives the handling feel of a sedan and can make it more maneuverable than a sport utility or crossover vehicle. With a variety of engine and transmission choices, today’s station wagon can be a real performance vehicle with all of the acceleration of a sedan. Top tips: Decide whether you want a new or used wagon. Do you want it for restoration? Or do you want it for immediate use? If you want the station wagon for immediate use, take it for a test-drive.

Diesel cars can give you up to 30 percent better fuel economy than gasoline-fueled cars, which means significant savings. Diesel may help cut down on maintenance All vehicles require a maintenance schedule to keep them running at optimum performance, but diesel vehicles may require less maintenance. This doesn’t mean they require no maintenance, just less, and any maintenance that is applied is worth the investment. For example, with diesel engines, there is no need for ignition tune-ups because they run on compression ignition instead of spark plug technology. Having less maintenance provides even further savings besides fuel costs. Their engine setup makes diesel cars more durable Diesel engines have to operate at higher temperatures and have been engineered to do this. This engineering includes higher quality material use and craftsmanship, which makes the technology last longer than the usual gasoline-fueled products. You get more power and torque from a diesel engine A diesel engine produces more energy than a gasoline-fueled one, resulting in more torque. Torque is especially important if you are going to be using your vehicle for towing because a higher level of torque means higher towing capacity. A diesel vehicle has better resale value Even if the body of the car isn’t in the best shape, the durability and performance of the engine will still make it desirable for another purchaser.

Connect with certified pre-owned dealers on Kijiji Autos Your well-being remains our top priority. Please seriously consider whether in-person meetings are necessary and visit our Help Desk for more information. If you’re new to the car-buying world, you might be weighing your options and deciding whether to buy new or used. But there's a separate category of available vehicles out there that acts like a hybrid of the two: certified pre-owned. While not technically new, certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles give you many of the perks of owning a new car without the price tag. Although they're a little more expensive than a pre-owned vehicle sold by a used car dealer or private seller, a CPO vehicle comes with better guarantees that you're getting the most from your investment. Here’s what you need to know about buying a CPO car: What does certified pre-owned mean? If a car is labelled certified pre-owned, it means that it has been returned to the original automaker or dealer in excellent condition. You get all the benefits of buying a new car at a much lower price. When you see the tagline “as good as new,” you’re likely looking at a CPO vehicle. A CPO vehicle is often a returned lease, which means that it likely has low mileage for its age and that the previous owner had it serviced by a mechanic certified by the automaker. Besides your home, buying a vehicle is likely the second biggest expense in your life, so you want to make sure you’re investing in something that’s going to last. If a car is certified pre-owned, you’ll have a better guarantee that your car won't run into any major problems. How do I buy a certified pre-owned vehicle with Kijiji Autos?
