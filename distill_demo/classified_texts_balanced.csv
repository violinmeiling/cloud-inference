Known for their responsive handling, powerful engines and elegant interiors, BMW 3 Series cars are a pleasure to drive. Whether you're looking for a classic 1980s BMW 3 Series or a newer model equipped with state-of-the-art tech, Kijiji Autos connects you with used BMW 3 Series for sale in your area. Choosing the right used BMW 3 Series for you The BMW 3 Series was introduced in 1975, so you can find a wide range of used BMW 3 Series for re-sale. Over seven generations, BMW has produced BMW 3 Series sedans , convertibles , coupes and wagons . While the current generation (2018 onwards) offers the most up-to-date tech and safety features, earlier generations have a larger variety of body styles. Try narrowing your search by filtering for used BMW 3 Series cars with gas, diesel or hybrid powertrains; automatic or manual transmission; or rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. One thing to keep in mind is that for 2022, the BMW 3 Series is only available as a four-door sedan. Advantages of buying a used BMW 3 Series When shopping for a luxury car like a BMW 3 Series, buying secondhand has big benefits. A used BMW 3 Series can be significantly more affordable than a new model, letting you afford a nicer trim level or upgraded features on a smaller budget.

But it's also clear that expected range and actual range differs a lot on driving habits. Does any website document *accurately* the actual range of specific cars under different driving conditions (i.e. highway cruising versus, suburban driving)? Are some manufacturers known to better estimate the range more conservatively or conversely over-estimate? Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

But which are the brightest sparks – and which are the loose connections?... by Darren Moss Published 09 February 2025 If you don't think that electric cars are yet in the mainstream of the new car market, then consider this – in 2024, almost one-in-five new car buyers chose one. And while the majority of those purchases came from businesses and company car fleets, that still means that thousands of customers chose a new electric car. Those buyers have more choice than ever, too, whether they're looking for a small electric car , an electric SUV , or something in between. There are also more brands to choose from, whether buyers want to choose from a traditional brand such as Audi or BMW, to one of the newer electric-only brands such as Polestar, or from a so-called 'Chinese' car brand like Xpeng or Ora. All of that choice means that knowing which EVs will leave you feeling fully charged and which are the not-so-bright sparks is more important than ever – and it's where this story can help. Our expert team of road testers has spent thousands of hours testing every new electric car on the market, focussing on the areas which matter most – from refinement to range, and from performance to practicality. And that means that when we name the best electric cars in the country, it's backed up by the most rigorous test regime around. Here, we reveal our top 10 electric cars, and tell you which model is better avoided. You can find out more about each model, and see the latest deals on each car, by clicking the links through to our reviews. Plus, we've answered some of the most common questions about electric cars at the bottom of this page. The latest What Car? Reliability Survey is live, tell us about your car now 1 Renault 5 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Grown-up driving manners Great infotainment system Tempting pricing Weaknesses Rear leg room is tight Small discounts Citroën ë-C3 and Fiat Grande Panda Electric are even cheaper With Instagram-worthy looks and a choice of bright colour schemes, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the new Renault 5 was a car built on style rather than substance. You'd be wrong, though, because even amid the crowded field of electric cars presented here, it's an outstanding champion. Indeed, we like it so much that we've made the Renault 5 our Car of the Year for 2025. Let's start with how far the 5 can take you between charges, with even entry-level models officially capable of taking you up to 193 miles on a charge. Go for our recommended 52kWh battery, though, and that figure jumps to 253 miles – plenty for most buyers, especially if you can charge at home. And speaking of charging, you'll be waiting a similar amount of time for a 10-80% top-up as you would for the rival Citroën ë-C3 , Mini Cooper SE and Peugeot e-208 . Inside, you'll find a comfortable and practical interior with a superb Google-based infotainment system that's easy to get along with. Plus, its physical climate controls are easier to use on the move than the purely screen or voice-based controls of some rivals. And while anyone approaching six-feet tall is inclined to feel a bit cramped in the rear seats over long journeys, the 5's boot is larger than those of the Fiat 500 or Mini. Then there's the price, because even the most expensive Renault 5 will cost you less than £30,000, which is more than £1000 less than the cheapest Mini Cooper SE. ""Unlike some rivals, there's no mechanical connection between the 5's brake pedal and the brakes themselves. I was nervous about this, but I needn't have been – teh system makes it easier to slow down smoothly than in rival electric cars"" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth Renault 5 review New car deals What Car? best price £22,995 Used car deals Finance this car with Drivenfi 2 Tesla Model 3 Reliability Safety Costs Quality Performance Strengths Fast and reliable charging via Tesla's Supercharger network Long range between charges Surprisingly practical Weaknesses Fiddly interior controls Handling not as entertaining as the best petrol-powered rivals Windscreen pillars hamper visibility Since its launch in 2019, the Tesla Model 3 has consistently been one of our favourite electric cars. Now, thanks to its latest round of updates, it’s the model to beat if you're looking for an electric car which matches up to the best executive models . The Model 3 is great to drive, offering sweeter handling than the rival Kia EV6 or Polestar 2 . It’s fast, too (ridiculously so in Performance guise), and surprisingly practical. The near-complete lack of physical buttons and switches (even the indicator stalk has been replaced with haptic buttons on the steering wheel) won’t suit everyone, but the enormous 15.4in central screen is at least pretty user-friendly. Factor in that the Model 3 is also competitively priced, and that buying one gets you access to the brand’s ultra-fast and convenient Supercharger network , and it’s easy to recommend. ""Every time we test a Tesla, it proves vastly more efficient than its rivals; the Model 3 averaged 3.7 miles per kilowatt hour of electricity used on our real-world test route."" – Will Nightingale, Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Tesla Model 3 review New car deals What Car? best price £39,990 Leasing deals from £287 pm Nearly new deals from £32,558 Finance this car with Drivenfi 3 Kia EV3 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Attractive entry price Long range (especially in the, er, Long Range) Comfortable ride Weaknesses Rivals have more versatile rear seats Not very agile Monthly PCP repayments are fairly high Kia's smallest and most affordable electric SUV has had some very impressive siblings to learn from – after all, the larger Kia EV6 is a former What Car? Car of the Year, while the even larger Kia EV9 is among our favourite electric seven-seaters. It certainly starts off on the right note, with even the most affordable models able to officially cover 270 miles on a charge, while the Long Range model ups that figure to 375 miles – more than the rival Hyundai Kona Electric , Mini Aceman or Smart #3 can manage. The Kia beats the Aceman and matches the Kona Electric on boot space, too, and we managed to fit six carry-on suitcases inside – the same as the Skoda Elroq . Speaking of the Elroq, the EV3's physical climate controls make it easier to adjust the temperature in that car, while elsewhere the Kia's interior impresses with an infotainment system that's easy to get along with, and the kind of high-up driving position which SUV buyers will love. When you're driving around town, the EV3's soft suspension does a good job of soaking up lumps and bumps, but the downside is that it doesn't make the car feel especially agile, and it leans more through corners than some rivals. ""If you're an audiophile like me, it might be worth looking at the range-topping EV3's kit list. That's because in GT-Line S trim, it comes with a premium stereo from Harman Kardon – perfect for your commuting soundtrack"" – Oliver Young, Used Cars Reporter Read our in-depth Kia EV3 review New car deals What Car? best price £30,550 Save up to £2,445 Leasing deals from £372 pm Nearly new deals from £25,495 Finance this car with Drivenfi 4 Skoda Elroq Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Comfortable yet good the drive Very roomy in the back Well priced and equipped Weaknesses Rear seats don't do anything clever No physical climate controls Heat pump costs extra Welcome to Britain's best family electric SUV . And to give the Skoda Elroq that honour makes complete sense – after all, it's about the same size and offers many of the same features as the Skoda Karoq, which is one of our favourite family SUVs, but benefits from electric power. Speaking of power, even entry-level 168bhp versions of the Karoq feel plenty quick enough, and the standard suspension setup does a good job of ironing out lumps and bumps in the road. The Elroq handles well for a family SUV, too, with well-weighted steering that's also accurate. It's just a shame that the brakes don't offer a better sense of feeling, but that's a problem which also affects the rival Cupra Tavascan . Inside, you don't sit as high up as you do in the Tesla Model Y , but there's a decent amount of space for adults. Plus, we managed to fit six carry-on suitcases into the Elroq's boot, which means your holiday luggage shouldn't be much trouble. It's worth noting that the rival Renault Scenic managed to carry one more case in our tests, though. ""When I was faced with picking up some flat-pack furniture, I was pleased to find the Elroq has a handy ski hatch, so I could load longer items through the middle of the car from the boot."" – Doug Revolta, Head of Video Read our in-depth Skoda Elroq review New car deals What Car? best price £29,798 Save up to £5,112 Leasing deals from £348 pm Nearly new deals from £26,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi 5 Volkswagen ID Buzz Reliability Safety Costs Quality Performance Strengths Surprisingly good to drive Hugely practical Strong resale values Weaknesses Fiddly air-con controls and infotainment Efficiency could be better The LWB version doesn't ride as smoothly as the SWB There’s so much affection for the retro design of the Volkswagen ID Buzz that its maker could easily have penny-pinched on the engineering and still sold as many as it could make. Instead, the German brand has clearly thrown everything at the car, and this has resulted in something that combines the practicality of an MPV with the comfort and refinement of a premium SUV and the low running costs of an electric car. The ID Buzz is good to drive – it can sprint up to motorway speeds faster than many conventional family SUV s, such as the 1.5-litre petrol-engined Volkswagen Tiguan – and is endlessly spacious, meaning more space for passengers and luggage than you'd find in a Jaguar I-Pace or Tesla Model Y . And in LWB form, it's one of the most spacious cars you can buy in any class. ""I've not come close to maxing out the ID Buzz's available boot space yet – even on trips to Ikea and the tip."" – Stuart Milne, Digital Editor Read our in-depth Volkswagen ID Buzz review New car deals What Car? best price £51,630 Save up to £8,975 Leasing deals from £490 pm Nearly new deals from £41,950 Finance this car with Drivenfi 6 Renault Scenic Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Bigger battery version offers a long range Cheaper than many rivals Five-star Euro NCAP safety rating Weaknesses Rear seat versatility could be better Spongy brake pedal feel Not particularly quick In times gone by, the Renault Scenic was a fairly frumpy family MPV which, although spacious, didn't have much else going for it. That's certainly not the case with the latest version, though, which has morphed into a cutting-edge electric car. To drive, the latest Scenic combines a long range – up to 379 miles, according to official figures – with the kind of pep which should make overtaking or getting the jump on urban traffic a breeze. Indeed, the 168bhp version can hit 62mph in around the same time as a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Skoda Enyaq . The rival Kia Niro EV or Tesla Model Y are even nippier still, though. The Model Y also places you farther from the road, but drivers seeking the kind of high-up SUV-style driving position which gives you a good view over the road ahead will be pleased with the Scenic. There's good head and leg room no matter which seat you're in, and you can fit more into the Renault's boot than you could into the Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6. Despite its lengthy list of attributes, the Scenic remains competitively priced, costing about the same as a Skoda Enyaq. Plus, resale values are expected to be stronger than those of most rivals. ""I was impressed with the Solarbay sunroof which comes on the Scenic's Iconic trim – it allows you to electronically darken sections of the roof, meaning the kids can stay in shade while you enjoy the sunshine up front."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Renault Scenic review New car deals What Car? best price £37,195 Used car deals Finance this car with Drivenfi 7 BMW i7 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Stunning interior Impressive optional 8K cinema screen Extremely comfy for all occupants Weaknesses Desirable options are very expensive Boot has a comparatively small opening If you're lucky enough to have someone do your driving for you, then the BMW i7 is one of the best luxury limousines on sale, offering technology, comfort and convenience in equal measure. Even if you're doing the driving yourself, though, it still out-shines its rivals. Entry-level models make do with 'just' 449bhp from a single motor, and that's enough to haul this luxury limo to motorway speeds in just 5.5sec. The other, four-wheel drive i7s, are nothing short of ballistically fast. Indeed, the eDrive60 xDrive will out-sprint the rival Mercedes EQS to 62mph. Not that there's much drama to be felt when reaching those speeds, though, because the i7 is as serene and as hushed as a Swiss watch. And with a cushioning ride, every trip is relaxing. From any seat, you'll be immersed in an interior that's both luxurious and filled with technology, while your luggage should have no trouble fitting inside the 500-litre boot. The EQS is even more capacious, though, and benefits from a more practical hatchback-style opening. ""Not that I'm one for sleeping on the job, but the i7's optional Executive Pack can replace the outer rear seats with lounge-style alternatives which, among other things, can fold down into a bed."" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth BMW i7 review New car deals What Car? best price £79,999 Save up to £21,776 Leasing deals from £1,452 pm Nearly new deals from £79,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi 8 Porsche Taycan Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Staggering performance and engaging handling Great potential battery range Wonderful interior quality Weaknesses It's very expensive... ...and you’ll probably want to add some options Reliability has been a concern The Porsche Taycan has long since ranked among our favourite electric cars – and this latest version has benefitted from a round of updates designed to make it even better to drive, even among a field of outstanding rivals. And, as you can see by its spot on this list, it's worked. Frankly, the Taycan is in a different league altogether from almost every other eletric car. Its steering, for example, is sweeter than that of the Mercedes EQS. And while entry-level models deliver plenty enough power for most drivers, the 4S model which we recommend can take you to 62mph even faster than an Audi E-tron GT quattro. Despite having more power than before, the Taycan can still take you a long way between charges. The 4S is officially rated for 346 miles, or 399 miles if you go for the optional larger battery. That's enough to get you from London to Glasgow without stopping, if you so wish. And you likely won't want to stop, because that could mean leaving the Taycan's sumptuous interior, which is beautifully finished and offers an excellent driving position. ""There's lots to like about the Taycan, but I think it's a shame that some of the functions for which its Audi E-tron GT sister car offers physical controls, the Taycan doesn't. Hitting some of the smaller icons on its infotainment touchscreen can be a pain while driving."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Porsche Taycan review New car deals What Car? best price £86,990 Save up to £4,000 Nearly new deals from £74,500 Finance this car with Drivenfi 9 Hyundai Inster Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Surprising amount of interior space Competitive electric range Lots of standard kit Weaknesses Renault 5 is better to drive Quite sluggish at higher speeds Limited to four seats Just because you've decided to go electric doesn't mean that you need to spend a lot on your new car. Indeed, the Hyundai Inster will cost you less than rivals including the BYD Dolphin, Fiat 500e and MG4 . It's not like you'll be scrimping on kit if you go for an entry-level version, either, because features including 15in alloy wheels, climate control, keyless entry and start and even an EV heat pump all come as standard. Drivers have two batteries to choose from, with the smaller 36kWh capable of taking you up to 203 miles officially. The larger 46kWh battery ups the official range to 229 miles, which is further than rivals such as the Dacia Spring and Dolphin can manage. There is evidence inside that the Inster has been built to a budget, with plenty of scratchy plastics on display, but the seats are comfortable and the Inster's driving position is sound. A word of warning, though, because there's only two seats in the rear, meaning a family of five will end up leaving someone behind. ""I was impressed that even at this relatively modest price point, Hyundai hasn't skimped on technology – the Inster's infotainment screen is quick to respond, for example, while every version gets a 10.25in digital driver's display. You don't get that in a Dacia Spring."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Hyundai Inster review New car deals What Car? best price £20,499 Save up to £3,006 Leasing deals from £290 pm Nearly new deals from £21,500 Finance this car with Drivenfi 10 BMW iX Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths One of the quietest cars we’ve ever tested Spacious and luxurious interior Great infotainment system Weaknesses Air suspension only standard on top-spec M70 Fiddly air-con controls Quicker depreciation than rivals BMW's largest and most luxurious SUV has always been easy to recommend, thanks to its combination of a long range and supreme comfort. And now, thanks to a wide range of updates, it promises to be even better. The headline figure is 426 miles – that's how far the updated iX can take you between charges, and means that even commuters who travel hundreds of miles in a day should find that they don't have to charge up with every journey. Then there's the power, which has been upped across the range. It means that even the entry-level 45 model produces 402bhp, while the range-topping M70 produces 659bhp. Most versions of the iX are quick to charge, too, with speeds of up to 195kW possible. ""I was worried that the iX would lose its intuitive rotary dial as part of its most recent facelift, and was overjoyed to see it remains – it makes operating the enormous infotainment screen that much easier."" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth BMW iX review For all the latest reviews, advice and new car deals, sign up to the What Car? newsletter here New car deals What Car? best price £67,619 Save up to £9,096 Leasing deals from £791 pm Nearly new deals from £48,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi And the electric car to avoid...

Read our review How we choose the best electric cars Every new electric car (EV) we assess is put through our comprehensive testing regime , which covers everything from performance and handling to practicality and running costs. However, we understand that EV owners’ needs can differ significantly from those of petrol and diesel car owners. That’s why we conduct an annual reader survey, in which we ask drivers of all kinds what topped their list of priorities when buying a new car . Here are the top three considerations among electric car buyers: Buying & ownership costs – a key attribute for 67% of electric car buyers Electric cars are typically more expensive to buy than equivalent petrol and diesel cars, but the best also promise to slash your running costs – especially if you charge your EV at  home. We weigh each new electric car against its closest rivals in both of these areas, considering  its list price, our Target Price discounts, monthly PCP rates, depreciation , servicing costs, insurance premiums and efficiency. Performance – a key attribute for 64% of electric car buyers We use highly sophisticated GPS logging equipment to measure a car’s acceleration and braking performance in a variety of situations, to make sure the way the car drives is fit for  purpose. We also consider subjective factors, such as smoothness of power delivery. Smoothness/quietness – a key attribute for 60% of electric car buyers Long journeys can be dramatically improved by a car which does a good job of isolating you from noise and vibration. That’s especially true in electric cars, where there’s no engine noise to cover up other sounds. We measure the sound inside each car we test in decibels at 30mph and 70mph, and conduct subjective tests to identify the source of any noises or vibrations, and find out when exactly they occur. Our expert road testers also assess how easy a car is to drive smoothly; some electric cars have overly grabby brakes, which can be disconcerting. You can read more about our full test programme in our how we test cars feature. FAQs Is it still worth buying an electric car in the UK? If going electric suits you over getting a conventional petrol or diesel car, a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid , then there can be significant benefits. The first of those is the potential for low running costs, especially if you have access to a charging point at home or your place of work. If you solely rely on the UK's growing public charging network to charge your electric car, it can be costly. Electric cars also make a lot of sense if you're a company car driver, since their lack of CO2 emissions means they'll cost you just 2% in Benefit In Kind tax – although that rate won't stay that low forever. Will electric cars get any cheaper? As with any new technology, electric cars are likely to get cheaper as the technology improves and develops, and the manufacturing process becomes cheaper. We’re already seeing more affordable electric cars being launched, including the Dacia Spring , MG4 and Renault 5 , which are bringing the starting price of electric models down significantly. And as more people buy them, the cheaper they'll become. What is the difference between an EV and an electric car? An electric car is a type of electric vehicle (EV). An EV can include any vehicle, from a car to a bus, which is powered by a battery and an electric motor. Which electric car holds its value best? According to our exclusive data, the Volvo EX30 in Twin Motor Performance Plus form is the electric car which will hold its value the best across 36,000 miles or three years of ownership. Indeed, it'll be worth almost 64% of its original value after that time. Other electric cars which hold their value well include the Lotus Eletre electric SUV, and the Porsche Macan Electric SUV. At the other end of the scale, our data shows that the Nissan Leaf is the electric car which loses the biggest percentage of its value over three years.

"Planned EV Battery Plant Is a 'Death Sentence' for Uncontacted Indonesian Tribe Skip to content Gizmodo Search Home Latest Tech Reviews Science io9 AI Video Deals Environmental Justice Planned EV Battery Plant Is a ‘Death Sentence’ for Uncontacted Indonesian Tribe Indonesia’s nickel rush threatens the lush forests of Halmahera and the people that still live within them. By Ellyn Lapointe Published June 27, 2025 | Comments ( 9 ) | 𝕏 Copied! Mining operations at Weda Bay Nickel, the world's largest nickel mine, on the Indonesian island of Halmahera © Nanang Sugi via Shutterstock On Sunday, June 29, Indonesia will break ground on a $6 billion electric vehicle (EV) battery plant on Halmahera, the largest of the Maluku islands. The facility will mine the island’s abundant nickel reserves and manufacture batteries on-site to reduce production costs in Indonesia, but a watchdog warns it could decimate an uncontacted tribe . The Hongana Manyawa—whose name means “people of the forest” in their language—are one of the last nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples in Indonesia, according to Survival International . Some 3,500 of them live within Halmahera’s rainforest, and roughly 500 remain uncontacted. Over the last several years, Indonesia’s booming nickel-mining industry has deforested more than 13,000 acres (5,000 hectares) of Halmahera’s tropical forests, destroying the Hongana Manyawa’s homeland. This country is now the world’s largest nickel producer, and its latest money grab poses a grave threat to the Hongana Manyawa, advocacy groups warn. “This announcement is a death sentence for the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa,” said Caroline Pearce, head of Survival International, in a statement . “Their home—the land that is theirs under international law—is being brazenly seized and destroyed to cater to global industries and global consumption.” “Nickel and other mega-projects are often launched under the banner of green development but leave behind a trail of social and environmental harm,” said Brad Adams, Executive Director at Climate Rights International, in a statement . “Communities are repressed, forests are cleared, and pollution goes unaddressed with impunity. This is a chance for the Prabowo government to show that it has learned from those failures.” The new plant, financially backed by China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), will integrate multiple components of EV battery production. Mining operations, smelting, nickel extraction, and production of precursors and cathodes will all take place on-site, according to the Indonesian news agency ANTARA . The project is one of 18 downstream industrial projects—valued at nearly $45 billion—that will break ground in Indonesia, ANTARA reports. According to a 2024 Survival International report , at least 19 mining companies are operating on the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa’s land, including the largest and second-largest nickel mines in the world. Most of these facilities are mining nickel, and together, they span about 40% of the uncontacted people’s territory. The Halmahera nickel rush is part of the Indonesian government’s efforts to feed the global nickel demand for EV batteries. As of last year, the country accounted for 51% of the world’s nickel mine production, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis . Scrutiny from environmentalists recently drove Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to cancel four nickel mining permits on the neighboring islands of Raja Ampat. “The President has a special concern to ensure Raja Ampat remains a world-class tourist attraction and protect its sustainability,” Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia told reporters earlier this month. In 2024, more than 30,000 tourists visited these islands, contributing roughly $9.25 million to locally generated revenue, according to The Jakarta Post . The same can’t be said for Halmahera, which lacks sufficient infrastructure to support tourism. Still, advocates hope that the Indonesian government will take similar steps to protect Halmahera and its people. “The Indonesian government has shown it’s prepared to cancel nickel mining to save tourism; it must now also do so to stop an appalling human rights atrocity,” Pearce said. “By acting now and establishing a no-go zone for mining on the territory of the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa people, the government can prevent their annihilation.” This tribe isn’t alone. A 2022 study found that 54% of critical mineral mining projects for essential components, like the nickel used in EV batteries, are located on or near indigenous lands . Of those projects, 29% impact lands that indigenous peoples manage or conserve. While the Western world may see the EV industry as a climate solution, its impact on rainforests—and the people that call them home—threatens to outweigh its benefits.

Hyundai SmartSense Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian/Cyclist Detection and Junction Turning ⁠ Standard on SE. When the system detects a vehicle, pedestrian, or cyclist in your path, it warns you of a potential collision. If you don’t begin stopping in time, the system may automatically apply braking. If equipped, Junction Crossing may apply emergency braking to help you avoid a collision with oncoming vehicles on the left or right while crossing an intersection. Additionally, Lane-Change Oncoming and Lane-Change Side Detection can help you avoid a collision with an oncoming vehicle or a vehicle ahead in the next lane by providing steering assistance while changing lanes. Finally, Evasive Steering Assist helps you avoid a collision with a vehicle, pedestrian or cyclist ahead in the same lane by giving you a warning and providing steering assistance, if needed, to avoid a collision. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with Junction Turning (FCA-JT) is intended to be a supplement to safe driving practices. The system is not designed to detect certain stationary objects such as trees or poles, and may not detect all vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists under certain conditions. The system’s Junction Turning function operates when the vehicle’s left turn signal is activated, the vehicle is travelling between approximately 6-19 mph and the oncoming vehicle’s speed is between approximately 19-44 mph. The system is a driver assistance system and is not a substitute for safe driving. The driver is responsible for being attentive and maintaining control of the vehicle, and should not wait for the system's alerts before braking as there may not be sufficient time to brake safely. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist Enhancements (Junction Crossing, Lane Change Oncoming, Lane Change Side, Evasive Steering Assist) ⁠ Standard on SEL, XRT, and Limited.

See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Blind-Spot Collision Warning (BCW) ⁠ Standard on SE. Your Hyundai notifies you with a visual alert when its radars detect a vehicle in your blind spot area. If you try to change lanes in this situation, an audio warning will sound. ⁠ Standard on SE trim. Blind-Spot Collision Warning (BCW) assists the driver by warning of other cars in the blind spot region. It senses the rear side territory of the vehicle when it is traveling over 20 mph. There are limitations to the function, range, detection and clarity of the system. It will not detect all vehicles or objects in the blind spot. Its operation depends on the size, distance, angle and relative speed difference between your car and other cars. BCW may not operate if sensors are obscured in any way. Do not rely exclusively on BCW. BCW is a supplemental system and the driver must still be attentive and exercise caution when driving. It is the driver's responsibility to be aware of the surroundings and ensure it is clear before changing lanes or directions. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Blind-Spot Collision-Avoidance Assist (BCA) ⁠ Standard on SEL, XRT, and Limited. If your Hyundai detects a vehicle in your blind spot while your turning signal's on, it will alert you and may automatically apply the left or right front brake before you change lanes. ⁠ Standard on SEL, XRT, and Limited trims. Blind-Spot Collision-Avoidance Assist (BCA) assists the driver by warning of other cars in the blind spot region. It senses the rear side territory of the vehicle when it is traveling over 20 mph. There are limitations to the function, range, detection and clarity of the system. It will not detect all vehicles or objects in the blind spot. Its operation depends on the size, distance, angle and relative speed difference between your car and other cars. BCA may not operate if sensors are obscured in any way. Do not rely exclusively on BCA. BCA is a supplemental system and the driver must still be attentive and exercise caution when driving. It is important to always signal, look over your shoulder and through your mirrors before changing lanes. It is the driver's responsibility to be aware of the surroundings and ensure it is clear before changing lanes or directions. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Blind-Spot View Monitor (BVM) ⁠ Standard on XRT and Limited. When you signal to change lanes, a live camera feed of the lane will appear on the digital instrument gauge display. ⁠ Standard on XRT and Limited trims. Blind-Spot View Monitor (BVM) assists driver in changing lanes by providing a live view of the blind spots on either side of the vehicle and an audible alert if another vehicle is detected. Turn signal must be activated and other system limitations apply. Do not rely exclusively on BVM. It is the driver's responsibility to be aware of the surroundings and ensure it is clear before changing lanes or directions. See Owner's Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Lane Following Assist (LFA) ⁠ Standard on all trims. Using the front-view camera to detect lane markers on the road, this feature assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle centered inside the lane. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Lane Following Assist (LFA) helps keep the vehicle centered in its lane only when the lane markings are clearly visible on the road. Lane Following Assist will not work under all circumstances and will not prevent loss of control. Lane Following Assist is a supplemental assist, and does not replace the need for extreme care and attention by the driver. See Owner’s manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) ⁠ Standard on all trims. This feature warns you through audio and visual cues if it detects your vehicle drifting out of its driving lane without signaling. If necessary, it may gently apply corrective steering assistance to keep you inside the lane. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) will not work under all circumstances. It operates above 40 mph and only when it is able to detect painted lane markings. It cannot function if the lane markings cannot be seen clearly. If the lines cannot be seen clearly due to poor road conditions, weather, or lighting conditions, it may not function. It also may not function on very rough roads, when walls, curbs or concrete barriers are close by, or if following another car too closely. Since it ""sees"" the lane markings using a camera in the upper windshield area, it is imperative this area be clear and free of blockage such as stickers, dirt, snow, tinting material, markings and labels. Lane Keeping Assist is not a substitute for safe driving practices, but is a supplemental assist only. The driver is responsible for always maintaining command and control of the vehicle and must keep hands on the wheel at all times. See Owner's Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ High Beam Assist (HBA) ⁠ Standard on all trims. Constantly turning your high beams off and on can be a hassle, which is why this thoughtful feature automatically does it for you. It can detect oncoming vehicles and toggle between high and low beams accordingly. ⁠ ⁠ Driver Attention Warning (DAW) ⁠ Standard on all trims. To help prevent potential accidents, this system monitors your driving patterns to detect drowsy or inattentive driving. Once detected, it alerts you with a sound cue coupled with a warning message on the instrument cluster. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Driver Attention Warning (DAW) is only a warning to inform the driver of a potential lack of driver attention or drowsiness. It does not detect and provide an alert in every situation. It is the driver's responsibility to remain alert at all times. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Forward Attention Warning (FAW) ⁠ Standard on all trims. This safety feature monitors the driver's attentiveness to the road using a driver-facing camera. If it determines you are distracted, it will alert you with an audible tone and a message on the instrument panel reminding you to stay focused on the road ahead. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Forward Attention Warning monitors the driver’s eye position using the vehicle’s in-cabin camera and may provide an audible warning if it detects driver inattention or drowsiness. It does not detect and provide an alert in every situation. It is the driver's responsibility to remain alert at all times. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Safe Exit Assist (SEA) ⁠ Standard on all trims. This pioneering innovation warns the driver when the vehicle is parked and its radar detects a vehicle approaching from behind. If necessary, it can override attempts to deactivate the Electronic Child Safety Lock until it’s safe for your child to open the door. ⁠ Standard on all trims. When the vehicle is parked, Safe Exit Assist (SEA) can alert the driver when a vehicle is approaching from behind. When Child Locks are active, SEA prevents initial disabling of the child safety locks if a vehicle approaching from behind is detected. SEA does not work in all situations and is not a substitute for driver or passenger attentiveness. Always be aware of your surroundings and attentive of approaching vehicles. See Owner's Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Smart Cruise Control (SCC) with Stop & Go ⁠ Standard on all trims. While traveling at a speed set by you, it uses a radar to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. After the system slows the vehicle to a stop, it will reactivate if the vehicle in front moves within 3 seconds. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Smart Cruise Control (SCC) is not a collision avoidance or warning device. SCC is for highway use only and should not be used in poor weather, heavy or varying traffic, or on winding or slippery roads. Driver remains responsible to slow or stop the vehicle to avoid a collision. See Owner's Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Highway Driving Assist (HDA) ⁠ Standard on SE. Helps maintain a set distance and speed from the vehicle ahead when driving on a highway and helps center the vehicle in the lane, even through a curve. ⁠ Standard on SE. Highway Driving Assist (HDA), is for highway use only and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead only when the lane markings are clearly visible on the road and should not be used in poor weather, heavy or varying traffic, or on winding or slippery roads. HDA will not work under all circumstances and will not prevent loss of control. Driver remains responsible to slow or stop the vehicle to avoid a collision. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA 2) ⁠ Standard on SEL, XRT, and Limited. Highway Driving Assist 2 helps keep you centered in your lane while also maintaining a set speed and distance from the vehicle in front. It also assists you when changing lanes. ⁠ Standard on SEL, XRT, Limited trims. Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA), when used in conjunction with Lane Following Assist, Lane Change Assist, Cut-in Assist, and Smart Cruise Control, is for highway use only and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead only when the lane markings are clearly visible on the road and should not be used in poor weather, heavy or varying traffic, or on winding or slippery roads. HDA will not work under all circumstances and will not prevent loss of control. Driver remains responsible to slow or stop the vehicle to avoid a collision. See Owner’s Manual for further details and limitations. ⁠ Rear Cross-Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist (RCCA) ⁠ Standard on all trims. When you’re going in reverse, it lets you know with audio and visual cues if its sensors detect a vehicle approaching from the left or right. It may even apply the brakes automatically if needed. ⁠ Standard on all trims. Rear Cross-Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist (RCCA) can alert the driver of a potential collision by providing an audible warning and/or applying braking.

How to keep an EV battery healthy and extend its life What is the Geotab EV battery degradation tool? Key Insights EV battery lifespan: Most EV batteries last 15-20 years, with an average degradation rate of about 1.8% per year under moderate conditions. Impact of charging methods: Frequent use of DC fast charging can accelerate battery degradation, especially in hot climates. Level 2 charging is gentler on the battery. Best practices for battery health: To extend EV battery life, keep the state of charge 20%-80%, minimize exposure to extreme temperatures and limit fast charging when possible. Electric vehicle (EV) battery health refers to an EV battery's condition and performance capacity over time. It measures how well the battery retains its ability to store and deliver energy compared to its original capacity. Maintaining good battery health is crucial for EV owners to ensure optimal range, efficiency and overall vehicle performance . But how long do these batteries last in the real world? By analyzing data from 10,000 EVs, we uncovered patterns, factors and insights that paint a clearer picture of EV battery longevity — and how you can make the most of yours. How long do EV batteries last? When we analyzed EV battery health in 2019, we found that EV batteries degraded, on average, at a rate of 2.3% per year. However, a new 2024 analysis reveals a significant improvement: EV batteries now degrade at an average of 1.8% per year. This improvement highlights ongoing advancements in battery technology and durability. According to Geotab research, EV batteries could last 20 years or more if degradation continues at this improved rate. This is particularly encouraging for fleet operators under pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions. Transitioning to EVs is the most effective way to cut emissions, and telematics data offers the insights needed to address lingering doubts about replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with EVs. Recent Geotab data shows: 75% of light commercial vehicles could be replaced by comparable EVs today. An EV could save $15,900 per vehicle over its life span. Do electric cars lose range over time? Yes, EVs do lose range over time due to battery degradation. However, with an average degradation rate of just 1.8% per year, EVs should retain most of their range for over a decade, ensuring their long-term practicality and value. What are common factors that impact battery lifespan? Modern battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) primarily use lithium-ion batteries , known for their efficiency and durability. However, several factors influence how long these batteries last and why their range may decline over time: Age: All batteries degrade over time, reducing capacity. Temperature: Extreme heat or cold accelerates wear, emphasizing the importance of thermal management. Operating state of charge: Keeping the charge between 20% and 80% minimizes strain. AC vs. DC charging: Frequent DC fast charging may degrade batteries faster than slower AC charging. Usage (energy cycles): Each charge-discharge cycle slightly impacts capacity. Battery chemistry: Lithium-ion types, such as NMC or LFP, vary in durability. Battery system and thermal management: These features help maintain efficiency and prevent overheating. To ease EV range anxiety , you can use diagnostic tools to monitor performance and prioritize EV battery maintenance to extend lifespan. Is liquid cooling or air cooling better for EV battery longevity? Liquid cooling systems are better for EV battery longevity than passive air cooling systems. As you can see in Figure 1, the 2015 Tesla Model S, which uses liquid cooling, has an average degradation rate of 2.3%. In contrast, the 2015 Nissan Leaf, with passive air cooling, shows a much higher rate of 4.2%. This data highlights how robust thermal management systems can greatly slow battery degradation. Figure 1: Battery degradation comparison of 2015 Tesla Model S (liquid cooling) vs. 2015 Nissan Leaf (passive air cooling). What is EV battery degradation? EV battery degradation is a natural process that permanently reduces the amount of energy a battery can store or the amount of power it can deliver. The batteries in EVs can generally deliver more power than the powertrain components can handle. As a result, power degradation is rarely observable in EVs and only the loss of the battery’s ability to store energy matters. An EV battery’s condition is called its state of health (SOH). Batteries start their life with 100% SOH and over time they deteriorate. For example, a 60 kWh battery with 90% SOH would effectively act like a 54 kWh battery. Do electric car batteries degrade? Yes, like all batteries, EV batteries degrade. However, EV batteries are, on average, exhibiting high levels of sustained health — and battery degradation rates are improving in newer models. Our latest research finds that EV batteries are degrading at 1.8% per year on average. The last time we analyzed battery degradation in 2019, we found an average annual degradation rate of 2.3% (which was already quite good). See figure 1 below for the battery degradation rates of the 11 EV models analyzed. Is EV battery degradation linear? While our analysis shows more or less linear degradation, as a general rule, EV battery life is expected to decline non-linearly: an initial drop, which continues to decline but at a far more moderate pace. Toward the end of its life, drivers can expect to see a final significant drop in battery state of health, as seen in the chart below. Figure 3: Expected battery degradation curve. How does temperature impact battery degradation? Temperature plays a significant role in why batteries degrade. EV batteries exposed to extreme heat degrade faster than those in cooler climates. For example, an EV in Arizona will likely have a shorter battery life than the same model driven in Norway. To study this, we grouped vehicles by climate: Temperate: Fewer than five days per year over 80℉ (27℃) or under 23℉ (-5℃) Hot: More than five days per year over 80℉ (27℃) Figure 4: Batteries exposed to hot days degrade faster than those in temperate climates. As shown in Figure 4, EVs in hot climates experience a faster rate of battery decline. This is concerning for fleets operating in high-temperature areas, but adopting EV battery maintenance strategies can help. Practices like optimizing EV charging habits and using thermal management systems are essential to keeping an EV battery healthy. Does high vehicle use impact battery degradation? Surprisingly, our research found that high-use electric vehicles do not experience significantly greater battery degradation than lower-use vehicles. This is encouraging news since EVs deliver better value when driven more frequently. The key takeaway? You can confidently use your EVs in high-demand duty cycles without worrying about accelerated battery wear, provided they stay within their daily driving range. However, frequent use of DC fast charging for high-use vehicles may contribute to faster degradation. Figure 5: Amount of use has a small impact on average degradation rates (~0.25% over 48 months) How do charging methods affect battery health? Our analysis showed no significant impact on degradation rates when comparing high-use and low-use vehicles — when controlling for DC charging use. However, analyzing the same vehicle model in a high-use situation exposed to different climates and charging power, we saw a strong correlation between high-temperature climates, frequency of high-power charge usage and battery decline. We were able to look at the predominant charging level used for the EVs in our system. North American EV charging stations are categorized into three common types: AC Level 1 (120 volts) – a regular home outlet in North America AC Level 2 (240 volts) – typical for home or fleet charging Direct current fast charging (DCFC) – for faster top-ups There is an observable difference in battery health between cars that routinely charge on Level 2 compared to those that used Level 1, but the difference is not statistically significant. Figure 6: Battery degradation for vehicles that primarily charge on Level 1 compared with Level 2. On the other hand, the use of DCFC equipment does appear to significantly impact the rate at which batteries degrade. Rapidly charging a battery means high currents, resulting in high temperatures, both of which strain batteries. In fact, many automakers suggest drivers and fleet managers limit the use of DC fast charging to prolong their electric vehicles’ battery life. Below, we look at all battery electric vehicles operating in hot climate conditions based on how frequently they used a DCFC: never, occasionally (0-3 times per month) or frequently (3+ times per month). Figure 7: Battery degradation appears to be strongly correlated with DCFC use for vehicles in seasonal or hot climates. How does the state of charge impact EV battery life? State of Charge (SOC) refers to the amount of energy an EV battery holds compared to its total capacity. A fully charged battery is at 100% SOC, while a completely discharged battery is at 0%. The ""usable"" charge, however, is often lower due to charging buffers, which are implemented to protect battery health. Operating a battery near full or empty can degrade its lifespan, so automakers add buffers to prevent extreme charge levels. These buffers limit the charging capacity through manufacturer settings, ensuring the battery doesn’t regularly hit its maximum or minimum charge levels. Figure 8: Battery protection buffers control the usable state of charge window for an EV. Many modern EVs, such as Teslas, can adjust the buffer size through over-the-air software updates, improving battery longevity. Some manufacturers also allow users to set a custom charge limit (e.g., stopping at 75% instead of 100%), helping further extend battery life. How does the buffer effect influence battery life? The buffer effect is designed to protect EV batteries from degradation by preventing them from charging too high or discharging too low. Automakers use these buffers to extend battery life, with larger buffers meaning less available energy for driving but a slower degradation rate. For example, the Chevrolet Volt (now discontinued) employed larger top and bottom buffers, which dynamically adjusted as the battery aged. This design resulted in slower-than-average battery degradation, demonstrating the benefit of these buffers in extending battery lifespan. Figure 9: Battery degradation over time for a Chevrolet Volt vs. all vehicles. How many batteries do you have to maintain on electric vehicles? Electric vehicles typically have two types of batteries to maintain: the main high-voltage battery that powers the vehicle and a 12-volt battery that handles smaller electrical functions like powering lights, infotainment and the vehicle’s control systems. While the high-voltage battery generally requires less predictive maintenance due to its design, the 12-volt battery should still be regularly checked, as it can wear out over time. You should monitor both batteries to ensure the vehicle operates efficiently, and some manufacturers offer monitoring systems that help track the health of both batteries. What is the purpose of the 12-volt battery in an EV? The 12-volt battery in an electric vehicle powers essential systems such as the lights, power windows, infotainment and other auxiliary components. While it does not drive the vehicle, it ensures all the low-voltage systems function properly, even when the vehicle is off. What happens to electric car batteries when they die? When an electric car battery dies, it can no longer store or supply enough energy to power the vehicle. Depending on the severity of the issue, the battery may need to be replaced entirely. However, many EV batteries are designed to last for many years, and when they do degrade, manufacturers may offer recycling programs to help safely dispose of or repurpose the dead battery. How to keep an EV battery healthy and extend its life While some factors are beyond an operator’s control, there are several best practices that drivers and fleet managers can follow to extend the life of EV batteries — and, by extension, the overall longevity of electric vehicles. Turn down the temperature Exposure to high heat accelerates battery degradation, making it essential to keep EVs in moderate temperature conditions for optimal battery health. At these temperatures, batteries may degrade slower than average. If you’re deciding which vehicle to purchase, consider models with liquid cooling for the battery since it offers better protection than air cooling. Watch the charge To maintain EV battery health, minimize DC fast charging, especially for fleets that operate high-use duty cycles. If vehicles are parked overnight, Level 2 charging should be sufficient. Avoid leaving vehicles with a full or empty charge; keeping the battery’s state of charge between 20% and 80% is ideal, particularly for extended periods of inactivity. If available, use adjustable buffer settings to automate this process and reserve full charges for long-distance trips. Put those vehicles to work Don’t hesitate to maximize the use of your EVs. High vehicle use does not negatively impact EV battery life, so you can reduce the total cost of ownership by increasing road hours. In fact, keeping EVs in regular operation can promote optimal battery health by maintaining steady charge cycles and preventing prolonged inactivity, which can lead to reduced efficiency. However, be mindful that frequent use of DC charging, especially in hot climates, may lead to faster degradation. Pay attention to your EV battery data Telematics data is crucial for understanding the health of your fleet’s EV batteries. With EV fleet management solutions , you can monitor real-time battery capacity, track degradation rates and make data-driven decisions to extend vehicle life. This data empowers you to take proactive or corrective actions, ensuring vehicles remain efficient and cost-effective over time. What is the Geotab EV battery degradation tool?

Please seriously consider whether in-person meetings are necessary and visit our Help Desk for more information. If you’re new to the car-buying world, you might be weighing your options and deciding whether to buy new or used. But there's a separate category of available vehicles out there that acts like a hybrid of the two: certified pre-owned. While not technically new, certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles give you many of the perks of owning a new car without the price tag. Although they're a little more expensive than a pre-owned vehicle sold by a used car dealer or private seller, a CPO vehicle comes with better guarantees that you're getting the most from your investment. Here’s what you need to know about buying a CPO car: What does certified pre-owned mean? If a car is labelled certified pre-owned, it means that it has been returned to the original automaker or dealer in excellent condition. You get all the benefits of buying a new car at a much lower price. When you see the tagline “as good as new,” you’re likely looking at a CPO vehicle. A CPO vehicle is often a returned lease, which means that it likely has low mileage for its age and that the previous owner had it serviced by a mechanic certified by the automaker. Besides your home, buying a vehicle is likely the second biggest expense in your life, so you want to make sure you’re investing in something that’s going to last. If a car is certified pre-owned, you’ll have a better guarantee that your car won't run into any major problems. How do I buy a certified pre-owned vehicle with Kijiji Autos?

There are lots of good reasons not to spend the kids’ college fund on the fanciest, six-figure EV — namely, sending them to college. Related: Electric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology You might be just looking for an efficient second car for city use or commuting in high occupancy vehicle lanes, where it makes little sense to pay top dollar for 400 miles of range when a 200-mile EV would serve your needs. Or you might have figured out (accurately) that by the time your new EV’s lease or loan is finished, a wider selection of EVs with much improved technology will be available. Or the higher-than-expected cost to install Level 2 home charging , all but essential to owning an EV, might have shrunk your budget for the car itself. Whatever your reasons, there are EVs available now that won’t break the bank, though they’re generally still more expensive than comparable gasoline vehicles. Note that availability can be relative for EVs. Some are sold only in certain states , while others may require a reservation for delivery weeks or months later. Below are 11 of the cheapest EVs you can buy, listed by starting price (including destination). The list features all-electric cars only; plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell models are excluded. Prices do not include the federal government’s tax credit, nor any state or local subsidies. Of note, the federal subsidy changes from year-to-year, with guidelines for vehicle eligibility based on battery and materials sourcing becoming stricter each year; read our full explainer here . The IRS also provides a list of automakers and vehicles that are currently eligible for the credit. Cheapest EVs 1. Nissan Leaf 2. Hyundai Kona Electric 3. Chevrolet Equinox EV 4. Toyota bZ4X 5. Hyundai Ioniq 6 6. Subaru Solterra 7. Ford Mustang Mach-E 8. Kia Niro EV 9. Nissan Ariya 10. Tesla Model 3 11. Lexus RZ Nissan Leaf 2025 Nissan Leaf | Manufacturer image Starting price: $29,280 EPA-estimated range: 149-212 miles The 2025 Nissan Leaf is a small four-door hatchback and was one of the first full EVs available nationwide when it rolled out in the U.S. as a 2011 model. Over the years, it has improved with more range and added safety tech. It also got a longer-range sibling, the Leaf Plus, with a bigger battery. For 2023 , the Leaf got some minor styling tweaks, and its lineup was simplified to a standard-range Leaf S and longer-range Leaf SV Plus. Nothing changes for 2025 , although it does lose its eligibility for federal EV tax credits. The cheapest standard-range Leaf S has a 40- kilowatt-hour battery, a modest 147-horsepower electric motor and an EPA-rated 149 miles of range. The interior has few frills, but it does have a standard 8-inch touchscreen with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . The Leaf SV Plus, meanwhile, has a 60-kWh battery, a significant range boost to 212 miles and a more livable 214-hp motor. Hyundai Kona Electric 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric | Manufacturer image Starting price: $34,425 EPA-estimated range: 200-261 miles This four-door subcompact SUV is mostly similar in styling and interior layout to the gasoline Hyundai Kona: It’s comfortable up front, but tight in the backseat and cargo area. Hyundai redesigned the Kona Electric for 2024 , making it longer, wider and taller. The base SE trim gets a 48.6-kWh battery pack and 133-hp electric motor, while the SEL, Limited and new-for-2025 N Line pack a 64.8-kWh battery and 201-hp motor. The Kona Electric’s cheapest SE variant comes with an EPA-estimated range of 200 miles, while higher trims come with a longer-range battery good for an EPA-rated range of up to 261 miles. While sales of the Kona Electric were previously limited to certain states with required zero-emission vehicle targets, its availability was recently expanded to every state except Wyoming and South Dakota. Chevrolet Equinox EV 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV | Manufacturer image Starting price: ​​$34,995 EPA-estimated range: 307-319 miles If you’re looking for an excellent bang for your buck, it’s hard not to like the Equinox EV. Its cheapest front-wheel-drive version is one of the longest-range electric SUVs on the road, offering 319 miles on a full charge, and Chevy says its 150-kilowatt charging capabilities can get you 77 miles of range in 10 minutes on a DC fast charger. To get the least expensive Equinox EV, look for the well-optioned base FWD LT trim, which comes with a suite of popular safety features, a 17.7-inch touchscreen, an 11-inch digital instrument panel and satellite radio. Toyota bZ4X 2025 Toyota bZ4X | Manufacturer image Starting price: $38,465 EPA-estimated range: 236 miles (for Limited trim only); 222-252 miles (estimated by Toyota) Toyota’s bZ4X SUV offers a choice of single-motor FWD or dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrains, with a 71.4-kWh battery pack for FWD variants and 72.8-kWh battery pack for AWD versions. Official EPA range estimates for all but the top-level Limited trim for 2025 have not been announced at the time of writing, but Toyota says the bZ4X is good for 222-252 miles of range, depending on configuration, with the base FWD XLE rated highest. That’s a possible bonus for budget-conscious shoppers, as the FWD XLE trim is also the cheapest at $38,465. The bZ4X skews toward comfort over performance; with FWD, the bZ4X has 201 hp, while adding AWD bumps the power figure up slightly to 214 hp. The bZ4X’s charging capabilities also lag behind those of some competitors, which may make it more suitable as a second commuter car rather than a road tripper. Hyundai Ioniq 6 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6 | Manufacturer image Starting price: $39,045 EPA-estimated range: 240-342 miles The Hyundai Ioniq 6 is a futuristic, streamlined sedan that’s also a great bang for your buck — and was named Cars.com’s Best Value EV two years in a row accordingly. It rides on state-of-the-art 800- volt battery architecture, and Hyundai claims it can go from a 10% state of charge to 80% in just 18 minutes on a 350-kW charger. To get the lowest possible price, you’ll need to select the SE Standard Range trim with single-motor RWD, which features a 240-mile range. It comes with a long list of standard equipment, ranging from driver-assist features like adaptive cruise control to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a heated, power-adjustable driver’s seat. Aside from the SE Standard Range, each trim offers dual-motor AWD as an option for an extra $3,500, though adding that does sacrifice some range. Subaru Solterra 2025 Subaru Solterra | Manufacturer image Starting price: $39,915 EPA-estimated range: 222-227 miles Subaru’s twin to the Toyota bZ4X is almost just as affordable after a significant price cut for 2025 , with its base Premium trim starting at just $39,915. The Solterra offers dual-motor AWD as standard, though, slightly undercutting the price of the least expensive AWD bZ4X. That base Solterra gets you the slightly longer 227-mile range, a total of 215 hp and 249 pounds-feet of torque, and a 72.8-kWh battery that Subaru claims is capable of charging from 10%-80% in just 35 minutes on a DC fast charger. Ford Mustang Mach-E 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E | Manufacturer image Starting price: $39,990 EPA-estimated range: TBA for 2025; 240-320 miles (estimated by Ford) Very little changes for the 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV aside from the inclusion of a more efficient heat pump for climate control as standard equipment and a repositioned gear shifter. Ford’s latest version of its BlueCruise semi-autonomous hands-free driving system also debuted as an optional upgrade for the model. The Mach-E’s least expensive Select trim features a single rear motor good for 264 hp and 387 pounds-feet of torque. While the Mach-E can get pricey fast (the top off-road-oriented Rally trim starts at $60,485), the base Select RWD clocks in at a far more frugal $39,990. Though we’re still waiting for official EPA figures to come out, Ford claims the Select offers a not-too-shabby 260 miles of range. Kia Niro EV 2025 Kia Niro EV | Manufacturer image Starting price: $40,995 EPA-estimated range: 253 miles The Kia Niro EV is part of a line of electrified-only hatchbacks that also includes hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions, all of which received a full redesign for the 2023 model year . Kia’s left well enough alone since then, with its small SUV keeping its single-motor FWD layout, 64.8-kWh battery pack and 201-hp motor that achieves an EPA-estimated maximum range of 253 miles. To get the price listed above, buyers should look for the base Wind trim; the loaded trim is the Wave. Nissan Ariya 2025 Nissan Ariya | Manufacturer image Starting price: $41,160 EPA-estimated range: 205-289 miles Nissan’s newest model added yet another affordable but likeable EV to its lineup, this time in compact SUV form. We were impressed with the Ariya’s tech and driving manners but were somewhat perplexed by its lack of a one-pedal driving mode. Price cuts for the 2024 model put it firmly on this list and addressed our main complaint with the Ariya — namely that its debut price wasn’t competitive in an increasingly crowded segment of EVs. For 2025 , the Ariya’s base price only raised $180, but you do get standard wireless phone charging in exchange. The cheapest Ariya, priced at $41,160, is the Engage FWD trim with the smaller 63-kWh battery. While that trim only gets you 216 miles of range, you can always upgrade to the $45,760 Evolve+ FWD trim, which packs the larger 87-kWh battery and a maximum range of 289 miles. Tesla Model 3 2025 Tesla Model 3 | Manufacturer image Starting price: $43,880 EPA-estimated range: 298-363 miles Tesla’s entry-level sedan, the Model 3, finally got a subtle styling refresh for 2024 with a more angular appearance outside and zero stalks on the steering column. Its blinkers are now capacitive-touch buttons on the steering wheel, and you put the car in Reverse, Park or Drive via the single large touchscreen in the center of the dashboard or via a touch-sensitive strip on the ceiling by the rearview mirror. While those might be polarizing choices, the Model 3 remains one of the most affordable options for an EV. The base Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive variant packs the longest range of the model line at 363 miles, per the EPA. Lexus RZ 2025 Lexus RZ 450e | Manufacturer image Starting price: ​​$43,975 EPA-estimated range: TBA for 2025; 196-266 miles (estimated by Lexus) Surprise! Bet you didn’t expect to see a luxe Lexus on this list. The 2025 Lexus RZ is surprisingly affordable, however, especially after Lexus debuted the RZ 300e as its new base variant for the 2024 model year. The single-motor, FWD RZ 300e offers the maximum 266-mile range for 2025, as well as 201 hp and 196 pounds-feet of torque. While official EPA figures aren’t out yet, Lexus’ own figures show that this upmarket take on the Toyota bZ4x/Subaru Solterra platform packs modest range specs like its downmarket brethren, but you only dip below 200 miles of range if you opt for the priciest RZ 450e Luxury AWD version.

It’s easy to see out of, undemanding and consumes long journeys with ease and in spectacular comfort. The massage seats are some of the best we’ve ever come across. Irrelevant?

Skoda Enyaq “Once more Skoda has built a car that could well be a better buy than the equivalent Volkswagen: the Enyaq edges both the ID.4 and Audi Q4 e-tron on several fronts. It drives just as well as its cousins, has a less annoying, more practical interior (particularly compared to the ID.4) and costs around the same or less than its sibling rivals. Best try all three before you commit to buying, but we know where we’d spend our money.” Read the full Skoda Enyaq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Polestar 2 “We love the Polestar 2 because it’s handsome, the build quality will give Audi drivers PTSD, and there’s a real sense of humility about the car. It’s been designed to work seamlessly, not to wow you with gimmicks then wind you up further down the line. Single Motor iterations make it more accessible for most too.” Read the full Polestar 2 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV6 “Distinctive yet unlikely to fall off a fashion cliff, rapid in a straight line but not dynamic enough to worry a proper sports car, the EV6 carves a very different path to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 with which it shares bones and blood. And that's no bad thing. But it's also spacious, quiet and a very capable cruiser, and equipped with that 800-volt architecture that makes charging station stops quick and painless. It's one of those cars that makes you think other countries are one step behind compared to what South Korea has to offer.” Read the full Kia EV6 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk BMW i5 Touring “The first all-electric executive-sized estate to the market. How did Avant kings Audi let that happen? While the four-ringed team has been asleep at the wheel, BMW has snuck in and delivered a choice of rear- or dual-motor electric luxe with a 570-litre boot. It’s refined, comfortable, easy to drive, swift, and almost too well-equipped for its own good.” Read the full BMW i5 Touring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Audi A6 Avant e-tron “We like the A6 e-tron, not least for the fact that it’s not an SUV. How refreshing. Beyond that it fulfils its brief well, carves cleanly through the air and travels a long way between charges. It’s a handsome machine that doesn’t try too hard to be an aero car, is super-smooth and refined and drives much like the big Audi saloons you’ve seen before.” Read the full Audi A6 Avant e-tron review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Renault Megane E-Tech Electric “This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it. Which is more than can be said of the ID.3.” Read the full Renault Megane Electric review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Macan “Porsche hasn’t dulled the Macan’s sheen with the switch to electric. If you want an incredibly well-rounded daily to deal with everyday life, the Macan stands out. It’s fast, comfortable, well-made and eminently practical - even more so than the ICE versions - and in Turbo form it’ll stay with a serious sportscar. “The main thrust is really the breadth of ability rather than one big headline; a comfy car in town with enough handling finesse to make it fun on a twisty bit of road. Where other mid-sized electric SUVs run out of ideas, the Macan gets going. It’s not cheap, but an absolutely solid effort from Porsche, and best-in-class.” Read the full Porsche Macan review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Fiat Grande Panda “The Grande Panda is an excellently low-cost and practical supermini – petrol or electric – with pretty special design. In a world where superminis are getting very little love from the manufacturers, that's a win. “The general aspect nods towards crossovers, and the detailing is heartwarming and original. All of which applied to the original Panda in 1980. This is a return for Fiat to doing what it has always done best.” Read the full Fiat Grande Panda review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Dacia Spring “The Spring’s appeal is that it’s everything that many electric cars aren’t: it’s not over-wrought or heavy-handed, it’s honest and enjoyable and manages to keep the dream of a low impact electric car alive and proves to everyone else it is possible for a battery electric vehicle to weigh largely the same as its petrol equivalent. Well done Dacia, let’s hope that where you lead, others will follow.” Read the full Dacia Spring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Skoda Elroq “The Skoda Elroq follows closely in the Enyaq’s footsteps, and for good reason. That car proved better than either of its VW Group siblings, and the Elroq - debuting Skoda’s new language - looks even smarter. It drives equally as well, and is just as competitively priced too. it oozes Skoda sensibility and will no doubt have competitors glancing nervously in its direction.” Read the full Skoda Elroq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Volvo EX30 “The audited CO2 footprint of a base-model EX30 out of the factory is only 18 tonnes; not much more than many petrol rivals. The UK electricity it uses to drive for an 8,000-mile year emits about 0.4 tonnes of power-station CO2, where a petrol car would emit 1.8 tonnes from its exhaust. So the EX30's lifetime CO2 is about half that of a petrol.” Read the full Volvo EX30 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV3 “The EV3 is just so roundly, crushingly competent in the same way a Golf used to be. Keenly priced and promising not to depreciate like a dropped ice lolly on a beach. Easy going and comfy to drive. Right-sized for families and not too bloated to park. It’s a roundly thought-out bit of kit as a ‘car’. And it doesn’t trip up when you factor in the ‘electric’ bit – adequate performance, strong range, and the ability to accept a speedy recharge. Not a given in an entry-level EV.” Read the full Kia EV3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk MG4 “On the face of it, the MG4 doesn’t seem like a very exciting car - certainly not something Top Gear would give a massively high score to. But when you dig into what it does for the money, how high it scores on multiple levels, it’s probably the only car in the class to recommend. It’s got range, charging, equipment, zippy dynamics and now some style.” Read the full MG4 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Tesla Model 3 / Tesla Model Y “This is the future we were promised – a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.” Read the full Tesla Model 3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk “A massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they’ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it’s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone.” Read the full Tesla Model Y review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Taycan “The Taycan can absolutely entertain on the right road and is a delight to cruise in - a GT with the heart of a sports car.

It’s still a galloping, ocean-going, 24-carat indulgence, but with a tasteful specification it’s just about possible to swerve absolute vulgarity. “It’s rich in the decadence of the so-called glory days but gratifyingly simple to operate for a product of 2023. While other manufacturers wrestle with the conundrum of transposing their family heirloom values into an electric future, the age of electric propulsion will suit Rolls-Royce very well indeed.” Read the full Rolls-Royce Spectre review Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Hyundai Ioniq 5 N “Right now, the Ioniq 5 N is an electric car that's as involving as a really good petrol car. In some ways it does that by brazenly impersonating a petrol drivetrain. The surprising thng is that's absolutely not just a gimmick. “Then in corners it has some original tricks of its own. It's not just fast, it's confident and playful so it's fun even when it's not going fast. It's useful and versatile too. “So it has many of the talents you expect from an electric car, and many more that so far are unique in EVs. Which makes us call it a new and brilliant chapter.” Read the full Hyundai Ioniq 5 N review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Renault 5 “The R5’s not the first premium-retro EV. It shares with the Mini and Fiat 500 a knowing silhouette, lavish external jewellery and a smart, cheery cabin. But it’s bigger than a Fiat 500 and goes further, and it's more practical than the Mini and copes better with bumpy roads. “It's not the cheapest EV either. But looking at performance and range, it's right in the sweet spot, and the bi-directional charging could help subsidise you outlay. Most of all it feels consistent: as charming to drive as it is to look at and to sit in. Your first love should last.” Read the full Renault 5 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Looking for more from the USA?

"Want an electric vehicle but not a Tesla? Here are some great alternatives - ABC News ABC News Video Live Shows Shop Log In Stream on Want an electric vehicle but not a Tesla? Here are some great alternatives Hyundai, Honda, Polestar and Porsche are building compelling EVs. By Morgan Korn May 25, 2025, 6:08 AM 2:59 The Ioniq 5 N is a sporty alternative to the Tesla Model 3. Hyundai Buying a Tesla has become a bit more complicated in the past year. The company's Model Y and Model 3 continue to be the best-selling electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for more than 40% of all EVs sold last year, according to Cox Automotive data. But Tesla's stronghold on the EV market is slipping. The U.S. electric automaker has seen its popularity dip in recent months, with insiders attributing the decline to more competition and Elon Musk's political views. Reports of Tesla owners selling their vehicles , violent demonstrations at Tesla showrooms and anti-Musk rallies across the globe have convinced some consumers to search for an alternative. The good news is that legacy automakers and electric startups are quickly answering that demand, unveiling new models that offer performance, styling and impressive range. If you're searching for an EV, here are some suggestions that could meet your driving needs. Model 3 Jason Cammisa, host of Hagerty's ""ICON"" series, said motorists have ""legitimate"" concerns about Tesla: ""Buying one is making a political statement,"" he told ABC News. But the Model 3 is also ""the best consumer product in the world,"" he argued. ""It's the best car in the world, period, full stop, not up for discussion,"" he said. ""You won't find a better car on planet earth, not at that price and combination of attributes."" He added, ""The thing about Tesla is that is spans so many different price points and socioeconomic situations ... you have value shoppers looking at Model 3s as well as billionaires."" Cammisa, however, has plenty of praise for several Model 3 competitors, including the Hyundai Ioniq 5 ($42,400), the Kia EV6 ($42,900) and Genesis GV60 ($52,350). ""The Hyundai products tend to hit all the marks well -- the packaging is good and the UX (user experience) works well enough,"" he noted. ""The Ioniq 5 N is the enthusiast choice -- it has drift modes and you get Lamborghini levels of performance in that car."" Cammisa said he reviews and ranks EVs on factors that may not have been top priorities for motorists in the past. ""The biggest differentiators in the market now are not things like powertrains and suspension tuning. The consumer experience is the real differentiator now,"" he said. Patrick George, editor-in-chief of InsideEVs, said he's heard from many Tesla owners who are ready ""to move on"" from their cars. ""They're done with Tesla because of Elon,"" he told ABC News. ""Getting rid of Teslas are a real thing."" He and his staff have compiled a list of non-Teslas to chose from, which includes the EV6 and Ford Mustang Mach-E. George noted that the BMW i4 and i5 were superb replacements: ""I was massively impressed with how those drive,"" he said. MORE: 'Cult following': Why automakers are still making wagons in the SUV era Model Y Jared Rosenholtz, editor at large for CarBuzz, has two favorite Model Y replacements: the Chevy Equinox ($33,600) and Porsche Macan Electric ($77,295). ""The Equinox EV is a fantastic little vehicle with a nice interior and more than 300 miles of range,"" he told ABC News. ""With incentives, the price will come in under $30,000."" The pricier Macan EV ""drives just as well as the gas version,"" according to Rosenholtz, who is also a fan of the Audi Q6 e-tron ($63,800), which is similar in size and power. Camissa, too, was impressed with the Macan, saying it had ""the best stereo I ever heard in a car."" ""The Macan EV is the total package,"" he said. The Macan EV ""drives just as well as the gas version,"" according to one industry insider. Porsche Rosenholtz also recommended the new Volvo EX30 ($46,195), a smallish yet mighty crossover that packs 422 hp and sprints from 0-60 mph in 3.4 seconds. ""The EX30 is super adorable and the quickest Volvo ever made,"" he said. Model S Cammisa, Rosenholtz and George all agreed that the Lucid Air, a handsome electric sedan that can travel at least 420 miles on a single charge, was without question a top competitor to the S, or any sedan on the market. ""It has unbelievably fast charging and drives amazing,"" said Rosenholtz. ""And you can get a Lucid for $10,000 less than the cheapest Model S."" The Air, which is available in four trims, has a starting price of $69,900. Owners can ""fill up"" their Air with 200 miles of charge in about 12 minutes if they opt for the Wunderbox battery charger, according to the company. Cammisa raved about the Air Sapphire ($250,000), which is priced like a Bentley and performs like a supercar: 0-60 mph in 1.89 seconds. ""It's the best-handling sedan ever made in the history of the world,"" he said. ""The Lucid Gravity is even better -- if you want a minivan looking SUV. Dynamically that thing is unbelievable and the packaging is unbelievable. I send people to Lucids all the time."" Hagerty ""ICONS"" host Jason Cammisa says the Lucid Air is ""the best-handling sedan ever made in the history of the world."" Rivian In addition to the Lucid Air, George listed the Porsche Taycan ($100,300) and Hyundai Ioniq 6 ($37,850) as two great options, depending on one's budget. ""The Ioniq 6 is outstanding on range,"" he pointed out. ""The Taycan is the OG Model S competitor -- it's more like a sports car with really fast charging."" MORE: New automaker Slate unveils a no-frills, stripped down electric truck for under $30K Model X Americans love their big, three-row SUVs and plenty of Model X challengers have hit the market in recent months. George said Tesla owners are increasingly turning to startup Rivian, which makes the fashionable R1S ute ($75,900). ""We've seen a lot of Model X owners move to Rivian. It's the closest to Tesla in so many areas -- software updates, range and performance,"" George said. ""Everyone who has gotten a Rivian has so far adored it. It's one of my favorite trucks."" Added Cammisa: ""The R1S is the EV that Range Rover owners want."" The trendy Rivian R1S SUV has become a popular choice among former Tesla owners. Rivian Cammisa still prefers the Lucid Gravity ($79,900), which is available to order now on the Lucid site. ""It does have the proportions of a minivan but the engineers have crafted the perfect commuter vehicle,"" he said. ""This thing has everything you need but the question will be: is this what people want?"" George also pointed to the Polestar 3 ($67,500), a sleek and haute SUV that can be configured in all-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive. The 3's long range dual motor model makes 489 horsepower and 620 lb.-ft. of torque and its dual chamber active air suspension improves the handling and ride quality by adapting to sensor input 500 times a second. ""The Polestar 3 is very Tesla-esque,"" said George. ""It's got great tech, outstanding performance and great styling."" Honda's Prologue ($47,400), the company's first electric SUV, has already been a hit with consumers since it launched last year. The interior is spacious, the optional panoramic roof adds brightness to the cabin and designers included high-quality materials and large buttons and knobs. Honda has partnered with General Motors on battery development and technology, so there are many similarities with the Chevy Blazer EV. ""The Prologue is a great gateway to EVs,"" said George, who noted how ""normal"" the Prologue drove compared to more aggressive regenerative braking systems. Plus, ""it has buttons if you don't want a car that's all screens and minimalist.""

The vehicle is marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models made by Tesla. The Model 3 was the world's top-selling plug-in electric car for three years, from 2018 to 2020, before the Tesla Model Y , a crossover SUV based on the Model 3 chassis, took the top spot. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass global sales of 1 million. A facelifted Model 3 with revamped interior and exterior styling was introduced in late 2023 for countries supplied by Gigafactory Shanghai and in early 2024 in North America and other countries supplied by the Tesla Fremont Factory . History [ edit ] Design sketches photographed at the Tesla Design Studio, 2016. 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance, rear In a 2006 interview with Wired Science , Elon Musk presented the Model 3 as likely being affordable by most people able to purchase new cars, aiming for a $30,000 price point. [ 5 ] In 2008 the car was stated to be a family car. [ 6 ] In 2017 Tesla added that the Standard Range version of the all-electric car would have an estimated EPA-rated range of 215 miles (346 km), a five-passenger seating capacity , front and rear trunks, and promised sports-car levels of acceleration performance. [ better source needed ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Tesla said it would have a five-star safety rating and have a drag coefficient of C d =0.225. [ 9 ] This is lower than the Tesla Model S drag coefficient of C d =0.24, which, in 2014, was the lowest among the production cars of the time. [ 9 ] Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car. These reservations represented potential sales of over US$14 billion . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Industry experts were dubious when, in May 2016, Tesla announced its decision to advance its 500,000-total-unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X , and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned, in order to accelerate its target for Model 3 output. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] As predicted, there were ""production bottlenecks"" and ""production hell"". In May 2016, Tesla issued US$2 billion in new shares to the stock market to finance the plan. [ 17 ] The company plans for the Model 3 are part of Tesla's three-step strategy to start with a high-price vehicle and move progressively towards lower-cost vehicles, while the battery and electric drivetrain were improved and paid for through the sales of the Roadster , Model S, and Model X vehicles. [ 18 ] On April 18, 2018, Tesla updated its production target to 6,000 vehicles per week by the end of June 2018, an increase from its previous target of 5,000 vehicles per week which was previously promised at earlier dates. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] On July 1, 2018, Elon Musk announced that Tesla had met its production goal of 5,000 cars in a week. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] On February 28, 2019, Tesla announced the availability of the highly anticipated Standard Range trim priced at $35,000 (equivalent to $43,045 in 2024). [ 26 ] However, on April 12, 2019, Tesla announced that the Standard Range model would no longer be available for ordering online, but only over the phone or in stores. Autopilot , previously a $3,000 option, was included in all versions of the Model 3 except for the Standard Range, while each version's price only increased by $2,000. [ 27 ] In February 2019, the Model 3 passed the Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car in the U.S. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Model 3 sales surpassed the Nissan Leaf in early 2020 to become the world's all-time top selling plug-in electric car . [ 30 ] Model naming [ edit ] During an interview recorded in 2006 Musk referred to ""Model 2"" (later Tesla Model S ), and to ""Model 3"" . [ 5 ] The Model 3 was codenamed Tesla ""BlueStar"" in the original business plan in 2007. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Model 3 , originally stylized as ""Model ☰"", was announced on Musk's Twitter account on July 16, 2014. [ 34 ] A 2015-presentation by JB Straubel used the name "" Model III "". [ 35 ] As of 2016 [update] Musk had wanted the three models to spell SEX , but settled for "" S3X "". [ 36 ] In early 2017, after trademark opposition regarding Adidas 's three stripes logo, [ 37 ] the triplicate horizontal-bar stylization was abandoned and changed to a numeric ""3"". [ 38 ] Market [ edit ] Tesla Model X (left) and Model 3 (right) at the unveiling event on March 31, 2016 In September 2015, Tesla announced that the Model 3 would be unveiled in March 2016. [ 39 ] In January 2016, Musk said that the first official pictures of the car will be revealed at the end of March 2016. [ 40 ] Delivery would begin in late 2017 first on the U.S.'s west coast and then move eastwards. [ 41 ] Potential customers were first able to reserve a car at Tesla stores or online on March 31 with a refundable deposit of US$1000. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] In February 2016, Tesla indicated that the unveiling would be on March 31, 2016. [ 44 ] [ 42 ] Current owners of Tesla vehicles got priority sales after employees but before the general public, as a reward for helping pay for the development of the Model 3. [ 42 ] (Employees and current owners were likely to be more tolerant of early production flaws: [ 45 ] both the Model S and the Model X had several problems at the start of their production.) [ 46 ] [ 42 ] About 125 people in line to pre-order a Model 3 in Walnut Creek, California , in 2016 During the Model 3 unveiling event, Tesla said that over 115,000 people had reserved the Model 3 in less than 24 hours prior; [ 47 ] more cars than Tesla had sold by that time. [ 10 ] Twenty-four hours after opening reservations, Tesla had advanced orders for over 180,000 cars. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Two days later, Tesla said they had 232,000 reservations. [ 10 ] [ 50 ] One week after the unveiling, Tesla said it had over 325,000 reservations, more than triple the number of Model S sedans sold by the end of 2015. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Musk said that 5% of reservations correspond to the maximum of two vehicles allowed per customer, ""suggesting low levels of speculation"", [ 51 ] and that 93% of Model 3 reservations are from new buyers who do not currently own a Tesla. [ 42 ] The previous record for advance deposits on a car was the 1955 Citroën DS that had 80,000 deposits during the ten days of the Paris Auto Show , while the Model 3 had 232,000 reservations in two days. [ 10 ] According to Tesla's global vice-president Robin Ren, China is the second-largest market for the Model 3 after the US. [ 52 ] Tesla said the number of net reservations totaled about 373,000 as of May 15, 2016 [update] , after about 8,000 customer cancellations and about 4,200 reservations canceled by the automaker because these appeared to be duplicates from speculators. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Upon its release in July 2017, there had been over 500,000 reservations for the Model 3, [ 55 ] with Musk later clarifying there were a net of 455,000 reservations outstanding, and an average of 1,800 reservations were being added per day. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] 2020 changes [ edit ] 2020 styling changes In November 2020, the Model 3 received exterior and interior styling changes, many carried over from the then-new Model Y crossover SUV, which was based on the Model 3. The most noticeable cosmetic change was that the previously chrome finished door handles, side mirror trim, window trim, and camera covers were given a black finish. [ 56 ] Other changes included the addition of a heat pump with an "" octovalve "" to improve climate control, a power-operated trunk, a redesigned center console with Qi wireless charging pads, and quieter double-pane glass. [ 57 ] Other changes [ edit ] Some hardware has also been removed over time. The adaptive cruise control radar sensor was eliminated in April 2021, [ 58 ] the front passenger seat lumbar support was removed in May 2021, [ 59 ] and the ultrasonic sensors used for park assist were eliminated in October 2022 and replaced with Tesla Vision, Tesla's vision based park assist. [ 60 ] 2023 update [ edit ] Tesla announced a design refresh of the Model 3 on September 1, 2023, bringing a longer driving range, lower production costs, technical improvements, and a restyled exterior and interior. [ 61 ] During development, the refresh was codenamed ""Project Highland"". [ 62 ] It was exhibited at the 2023 Munich Motor Show. [ 63 ] Tesla said the refreshed Model 3 improved range around 10%, largely from a lower and more aerodynamic nose along with a better rear diffuser and more aerodynamic wheels. The tires protrude slightly from the rims, protecting them from curb rash. They have lower rolling resistance, but no compromise in lateral performance or steering response. This was enabled by changing materials and removing 1 ply (made possible by lowering the top, rarely used, speed). The gap between tire and body was reduced. [ 64 ] The drag coefficient of C d =0.219 improved from 0.225. Redesigned tail lights eliminated the vertical break between trunk and side. [ 64 ] Interior additions included an 8-inch (200 mm) touchscreen (with Bluetooth audio) for rear seat passengers, ventilated front seats, up to 17-speaker sound system (up from 14), customizable interior accent lighting, and a new steering wheel without turn signal and gear selector stalks. [ 65 ] In June 2024, the Edmunds website called the turn signal buttons on the steering wheel ""unsafe"", criticizing both the absence of a stalk and the design and placement of the buttons. [ 66 ] The touchscreen for rear seat passengers and the steering wheel without stalks are changes that were previously implemented on the Model S and X during their ""Palladium"" refresh. Traditional turn signals returned in the 2025 Model Y refresh. [ 67 ] The upgrade had shock-absorbing technology called Frequency Selective Damping, which uses a hydraulic amplifier to concentrate vibration in the 4–6 Hz range. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The update came equipped with HW4 camera and processing technology, which permitted a wider field of view and improved Autopilot's cross-traffic emergency braking. [ 64 ] Gigafactory Shanghai was the first of Tesla's factories to begin making the refreshed Model 3, with the company offering the vehicle for sale in China and markets to which Tesla exports from China, including Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Japan. [ 61 ] The refreshed Model 3 was made available for order in North America on January 10, 2024, with these models being produced at the Tesla Fremont Factory. [ 70 ] 2023 refresh, front 2023 refresh, rear 2023 refresh, Performance trim, front 2023 refresh, Performance trim, rear 2023 refresh, interior Design [ edit ] Original Tesla Model 3 interior, without center console Qi chargers In 2013, design chief Franz von Holzhausen called the Model 3, ""an Audi A4 , BMW 3 Series , Mercedes-Benz C-Class type of vehicle that will offer everything: range, affordability, and performance"" that is targeted toward the mass market. [ 1 ] [ 71 ] While technology developed for Tesla's earlier Model S sedan was used in the Model 3, [ 72 ] it is 20% smaller than the Model S [ 73 ] and has its own unique design. [ 74 ] One of the most striking and noticeable design choices on the Model 3 was the lack of a front grille. [ 75 ] Since electric cars have lower cooling needs than combustion cars, they do not need a front grille, yet many, including the Model S, have one to fit in with the design of other vehicles. [ 76 ] All trim levels include an expansive glass roof developed by the Tesla Glass group, from the same glass used for the Tesla Solar Roof . [ 77 ] Center-mounted 15.4-inch (39 cm) touchscreen , [ 78 ] showing the user interface from December 2020 [ 79 ] The interior of the Model 3 has been described as minimalist or stark, with few physical controls, instead housing most controls in a single 15.4 in (390 mm) center-mounted touchscreen. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Critics praised the screen's interface, but pointed out that the decision requires drivers navigate menus to accomplish what could otherwise be controlled by a button or knob. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Tesla is also notable for being one of the few automakers offering no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Production [ edit ] Gigafactory Shanghai has been producing the Model 3 since December 2019 for both the local China market and for export to other areas except the United States. [ 82 ] Production stages [ edit ] In a 2013 interview, Jerome Guillen discussed ""BlueStar"" (codename for the Model 3 project), stating that Tesla was expecting to eventually produce 400,000 cars per year. [ 83 ] In May 2016 Tesla told its suppliers that it intended to double earlier-announced [ clarification needed ] Model 3 production targets to 100,000 in 2017 and 400,000 in 2018 due to demand, which suppliers [ 84 ] [ 85 ] and many experts viewed as unattainable. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] In the Tesla Factory, paint lines for 500,000 automobiles commenced in 2015, and some stamping equipment for the Model 3 was operational by August 2016. [ 88 ] Tesla bought Grohmann Engineering , experienced in automated manufacturing, in January 2017. This acquisition launched Tesla Advanced Automation Germany, which Tesla said would develop manufacturing processes to be used initially in Model 3 production. [ 89 ] According to Tesla in late 2016, the company expected to invest between US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production. [ 89 ] After the two Alpha prototypes were shown (silver and black; red was a shell) in April 2016, Tesla finished the design in late July 2016. Tesla ordered parts equivalent to 300 Beta prototypes in August 2016, preparing for development of the assembly line. As of August 2016, the company intended to make release candidates for testing prior to actual production. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Tesla began building Model 3 prototypes in early February 2017 as part of the testing of the vehicle design and manufacturing processes. Tesla said in late 2016 that initial crash test results had been positive. [ 89 ] Crash test results in mid-2019 were scored at 96% for protection of adults; 86% for protection of children and 74% for the way it handles ""vulnerable road users"" such as pedestrians. In addition, the Model 3's ""safety assist"" mode scored 94%. [ 92 ] In October 2016 Tesla said its production timeline was on schedule. [ 93 ] Again in February 2017, Tesla said that vehicle development, supply chain and manufacturing are on track to support volume deliveries of the Model 3 in the second half of 2017. Limited vehicle production began in July 2017 and volume production was scheduled at that time to start by September 2017. As of February 2017, Tesla planned to ramp up production to exceed 5,000 vehicles per week in Q4 2017 and reach 10,000 vehicles per week in 2018. [ 89 ] However, Tesla missed their Q4 production target by a wide amount, as only 2,425 vehicles were produced during the entire 3-month period. [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Giga Nevada had been intended to produce battery packs for Model 3 and it was announced in January 2017 that Tesla would also manufacture drive units [ clarification needed ] at Giga Nevada. [ 96 ] In February 2017, Tesla said that installation of Model 3 manufacturing equipment was underway in the Fremont factory and at Giga Nevada, where in January, production of battery cells for energy-storage products began, which have the same form factor as the cells that will be used in Model 3. [ 89 ] Deliveries [ edit ] Year Model 3 vehicles delivered 2017 [ 97 ] 1,764 2018 [ 98 ] 145,846 2019 [ 99 ] 300,885 Year Model 3/Y vehicles delivered 2020 [ 100 ] 442,511 2021 [ 101 ] 911,208 2022 [ 102 ] 1,247,146 2023 [ 103 ] 1,739,707 2024 [ 104 ] 1,704,093 In February 2016 Tesla expected the Model 3 to repeat the delivery schedule of the S and X models: selling at first the highest-optioned cars with higher margins, to help pay for production equipment. [ 105 ] However, after the lessons learned from the complicated Model X production, Tesla changed its delivery schedule in early 2017 to produce relatively simpler cars initially, in order to reduce production risk. The first mass-produced Model 3 cars were rear-wheel drive with the long-range battery. [ 106 ] Deliveries began in the second half of 2017 as predicted, [ 41 ] but not in the numbers Tesla had hoped. As industry experts had predicted, Tesla did not meet the announced delivery targets. [ clarification needed ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ] 2017 [ edit ] In early July 2017 Musk forecast at least six months of serious production difficulties. [ 107 ] Tesla's announced goal at that time was to produce 1,500 units in the third quarter of 2017, increasing to 5,000 per week by end of December 2017, [ 108 ] but only 260 vehicles were manufactured during the third quarter. The company blamed production bottlenecks, but said there were ""no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain"" and expressed confidence about its ability to resolve the bottlenecks in the near future. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Tesla delivered just 1,542 Model 3 cars in the fourth quarter of 2017, [ 111 ] about 2,900 fewer than Wall Street estimations, which were already halved previously after Tesla published the company's third quarter report. [ 112 ] By early November 2017, Musk had postponed the target date for manufacturing 5,000 of the vehicles per week from December 2017 to March 2018. [ 113 ] [ 20 ] An analyst with Cowan and Company, an investment banking firm, said in November 2017 that ""Elon Musk needs to stop over-promising and under-delivering"". [ 114 ] Customer deliveries totaled 1,764 units in 2017. [ 97 ] [ 111 ] 2018 [ edit ] Prior to a planned shutdown in mid-April 2018 to further increase production, Tesla produced more than 2,000 Model 3 vehicles for three straight weeks. [ 115 ] Global deliveries passed 100,000 units as of October 2018. [ 116 ] U.S. Model 3 sales hit 100,000 units in November 2018, reaching this milestone quicker than any previous plug-in electric model. [ 117 ] During the first half of 2018, the Model 3 was the top-selling alternative fuel vehicle in California with 12,674 units, followed by the Toyota Prius conventional hybrid (10,043). [ 118 ] The Model 3 was the top-selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. for 12 months in a row through December 2018, ending 2018 as the bestselling plug-in with an estimated 139,782 units delivered, the first time a plug-in car sold more than 100,000 units in one year. [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Additionally, the Model 3 ranked as the bestselling luxury vehicle in the American market in 2018. [ 122 ] The Model 3 topped plug-in electric car sales in California in 2018, with 51,293 units registered, and was the state's best-selling car in the near luxury category . [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Model 3 was the world's best-selling plug-in electric car in 2018. [ 125 ] In 2018, Elon Musk predicted that eventual global demand would likely be between 500,000 and 1 million Model 3 cars per year— ranking in between the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf . [ 126 ] 2019 [ edit ] The Model 3 was the world's best selling plug-in electric car for three years in a row (2018 to 2020). [ 127 ] [ 125 ] [ 128 ] CCS Combo 2 European socket on a Model 3 Retail deliveries in Europe and China began in February 2019. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] Delivery of the first right-hand drive vehicles began in June 2019, starting with the UK [ 131 ] and later in Australia and New Zealand. [ 132 ] Similarly to how the first US-made Model 3s were delivered in July 2017, the first Chinese-made Model 3 cars were delivered to employees at the end of 2019. [ 133 ] In January 2019 the Model 3 overtook the Model S as the U.S. all-time best selling all-electric car, [ 134 ] and, the next month, also passed the Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time top selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. [ 28 ] The Tesla Model 3 ended 2019 as the world's best-selling plug-in electric car for the second consecutive year, with just over 300,000 units delivered. [ 125 ] [ 128 ] The electric car also topped annual plug-in car sales in the U.S. (158,925) and California (59,514) markets for the second time in a row. [ 119 ] [ 123 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] And again listed as the California's best-selling car in the near luxury category in 2019. [ 136 ] The Model 3 also ranked as the best-selling plug-in car in Europe in 2019, with over 95,000 units delivered in its first year in that market, and outselling other key premium models. [ 137 ] It also set records in Norway and the Netherlands, not only as the top selling plug-in car but also as the best-selling passenger car model overall. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] The sales volume achieved by the Model 3 in 2019 (15,683) is the third largest in Norwegian history, exceeded only by the Volkswagen Bobla (Beetle) in 1969 (16,706), and Volkswagen Golf in 2015 (16,388). [ 140 ] The Model 3 set a new record in the Netherlands for the highest registrations in one month (22,137) for any single plug-in vehicle in Europe. [ 141 ] The Model 3 also was the top selling plug-in car in Canada, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Mexico. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] 2020 [ edit ] Until 2019, the Nissan Leaf was the world's best-selling plug-in electric car , with global sales of 450,000 units by December 2019. [ 144 ] The Tesla Model 3 surpassed Leaf sales in early 2020 to become the world's best-selling plug-in electric car ever. [ 30 ] Global sales totaled about 814,000 units overall up to December 2020. [ 127 ] [ 97 ] [ 111 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ] The Model 3, with 365,240 global deliveries, was the world's best-selling plug-in passenger car in 2020 for the third consecutive year. [ 125 ] [ 128 ] [ 127 ] Gigafactory Shanghai began to ramp up production in 2020, producing vehicles for sale in China and for export. [ 147 ] In 2020, the Model 3 was the bestselling plug-in car in China (137,459) and the U.S. (95,135). [ 148 ] [ 149 ] The Model 3 also was the most popular plug-in electric car in California in 2020 (38,580), as well as the state's best-selling car in the near luxury category. [ 150 ] The Model 3 has topped both California's and the U.S. national plug-in car sales for three years in-a-row, from 2018 to 2020. [ 148 ] [ 120 ] [ 135 ] [ 150 ] 2021 [ edit ] In 2021, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling electric vehicle in the Netherlands with over 78,996 cars registered at the end of June 2021. [ 151 ] The Model 3 became the first electric car to sell over 1 million units globally in June 2021. [ 152 ] It was also the bestselling electric vehicle of 2021 in the UK, with 34,783 registered, beating the second most popular electric car, the Kia e-Niro , by over 22,500 registrations. These figures also made the Model 3 the second bestseller in the UK new car market in 2021, only beaten by the Vauxhall Corsa , a cheaper B-segment vehicle. The 9,612 Model 3s sold in December were more than double the sales of any other car in that month. [ 153 ] In October 2021, Hertz car rental ordered 100,000 full-price Model 3 cars for its rental fleet. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Hertz had to resell most of the cars as demand was lower than expected and depreciation costs had mounted. [ 156 ] Concerns [ edit ] In May 2018 Consumer Reports found ""big flaws, such as long stopping distances in our emergency braking test and difficult-to-use controls"", finding the braking distance was worse than a Ford F-150 full-size truck, and branding the Model 3 ""not recommended"". Tesla responded to the claims with concern and, over the next weekend, released an OTA update for the anti-lock braking algorithm. Consumer Reports, impressed with the prompt OTA update, verified the improved braking performance and changed their rating to a recommended model. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] In February 2019 Consumer Reports revoked the Model 3 recommendation because ""many customers have reported problems with the [car], including loose body trim and glass defects."" [ 159 ] As with Model S and Model X, Model 3 production flaws were reduced over time. [ 160 ] In November 2019 Consumer Reports reinstated the Model 3 recommendation, claiming it was the fifth-most reliable of twelve compact luxury cars. [ 161 ] During long-term testing of a Model 3 in December 2019, Car and Driver experienced a rear inverter short after 5,286 miles (8,507 km) and 3 months of ownership. [ 162 ] It was their first long-term vehicle to suffer such a major failure while parked. [ 163 ] In 2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, closure of the Shanghai factory at the end of January, and supply chain issues, Tesla used the 2.5 version processor instead of the 3.0 processor that Chinese users expected to find in their vehicles. This led to mass complaints. Tesla promised to upgrade the hardware free of charge once the supply chain is restored. [ 164 ] The 2021 Tesla Model 3 vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021, had modified Forward Collison Warning (FCW) and Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) safety features, resulting in lower Consumer Reports and Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) scores. The change was from using Radar to Camera technology called Tesla Vision. [ 165 ] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation over phantom braking in these new vehicles. [ 166 ] [ 167 ] In May 2022, a relay attack was discovered where an attacker could gain remote control of a Model 3 (or a Model Y) if they could get within range of a Bluetooth key of the owner. [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Specifications [ edit ] First production Tesla Model 3 cars ready for the delivery event on July 28, 2017 Motor [ edit ] Instead of a traditional induction motor , the Model 3's primary (rear) motor uses internal permanent magnets (IPM) with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. Compared to an induction motor, the aluminum squirrel-cage rotor is replaced by an iron rotor , with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces . For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron's reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] The IPM-SynRM motor is responsible for most of the propulsion in both the RWD and AWD Model 3s. The induction motor on the front axle of the AWD models provides additional power and helps to improve handling. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Battery [ edit ] For the Model 3, Tesla initially decided to use 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cells. Compared with the 18650-type batteries that the company had been using since its first generation Roadster, the 2170 batteries were optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. [ 175 ] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic 's production line at Gigafactory Nevada. [ 175 ] For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai, batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution 's factories in China. [ 175 ] As lower-cost models were introduced, Tesla started using prismatic (rectangular) cells with a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry in vehicles produced in both factories. [ 175 ] LFP batteries are less energy-dense (which reduces range), but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes them less expensive to produce. [ 176 ] Unlike other types, LFP batteries achieve less degradation when being regularly charged to 100 percent. Tesla sources these batteries from CATL in China. [ 175 ] Engineering and changes [ edit ] When production began in 2017, the base Model 3 was announced to have a 50-kWh battery with a range of about 220 miles (350 km) while the optional 75-kWh battery would have a range of about 310 miles (500 km). [ 177 ] The 350-volt (nominal, 400v max) Model 3 battery packs are made of four longitudinal modules each containing the groups (bricks). The Standard Range version carries 2,976 cells arranged in 96 groups of 31. The Long Range version carries 4,416 cells arranged in 96 groups of 46, and weighs [ 178 ] 1,060 pounds (480 kg) in a 14 cu ft (0.40 m 3 ) volume; a density of 150 Wh/kg (540 kJ/kg). [ 179 ] [ 180 ] The car's onboard AC/DC converter is 11 kW. [ 181 ] In Europe this requires three-phase electric power , otherwise single-phase power is 7.4 kW. [ 182 ] Tesla continues to improve the design of the 2170 battery cell and introduces incremental improvements into the manufacturing line periodically. [ 183 ] The inverter for the Model 3 drive unit uses 24 pairs of silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET chips rated for 650 volts [ clarification needed ] each. [ 184 ] In May 2019 Tesla started offering an optional tow bar rated for 2,000 pounds (910 kg) available with Standard Range Plus and Long Range for the European Model 3. [ 185 ] [ 186 ] [ 187 ] In December 2019, Tesla offered Long Range dual-motor Model 3 owners who had software version 2019.40.2 the option to purchase a US$2000 ""Acceleration Boost"" software upgrade enabling a Sport driving mode, [ 188 ] advertised to reduce 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time from 4.4s to 3.9s. Road testing confirmed better-than-expected acceleration with drivers in Sport mode reaching 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.67s from standstill and 3.47s with a 1-foot rollout. [ 189 ] Structurally, the Model 3 is mostly steel, and most body panels are aluminum. [ 190 ] [ 191 ] Due to its smaller size, the Model 3 is expected to consume less energy than the Model Y, and thus have longer range. [ 192 ] Traditional stability control is not made for dual-motor control or the faster response time in electric motors, and Tesla modified the control unit. [ 193 ] The cooling system is integrated to reduce size and cost. [ 194 ] Sometime during August 2020, Tesla added heating hardware to the Model 3's charge port which was enabled by software update later in the year to prevent ice buildup. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] Beginning in October 2023 (most markets) or January 2024 (US market), Model 3 cars were delivered with changes for the ""Highland"" refresh. Tesla states that fifty percent of the Model 3's components have been changed for the 2024 Highland version. [ 197 ] The changes included a revised suspension emphasizing ride comfort, additional noise reduction, lack of stalks on the steering column, ventilated front seats, a small rear screen, slightly improved aerodynamics, and new headlights, taillights, and wheels. [ 198 ] The shifter has been removed and the gear may be selected on the touchscreen, or by simply letting the vehicle's predictive software select the appropriate gear. For emergency purposes, there are P-R-N-D buttons above the front windshield. [ 199 ] In Singapore, Tesla offers a version of the Model 3 (called the RWD 110 ) with a limited 110 kW (150 PS) engine output. This engine power cap results in the so-called COE Cat A status and therefore lower road taxes. Its 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) acceleration takes 8.6 s ( RWD : 170 kW, 231 PS, 0–100 km/h in 6.1 s).

This allows Tesla to make its debut in automobile racing . [ 238 ] Reliability [ edit ] In November 2024, the Tesla Model 3 ranked last in a Technical Inspection Association (TÜV) analysis of the results of road-worthiness inspections for newer cars in Germany and Austria. These inspections are mandatory in Germany. [ 239 ] According to TÜV, the comparatively high failure rate can be partly explained by the fact that Tesla does not require regular maintenance. [ 240 ] In Denmark, 23% of Tesla Model 3 model year 2020 failed their first inspection in 2024, as compared to 9% of electric cars from other brands that failed the inspection. [ 241 ] Reception [ edit ] Tesla Model 3s in colors Silver Metallic (left) and Midnight Silver (right) Car-design columnist and former car designer for GM Robert Cumberford said the Model 3 ""is an excellent design"" and praised the front fascia skin that he thinks is superior to the black plastic simulated grille of the pre-refresh Model S. [ 242 ] [ 243 ] Cumberford praised the Model 3's minimalist design, and ""elegant simplicity"" akin to Apple products. [ 244 ] Although he criticized the car's spoiler, he said the Model 3 has a design that would age well, and ""in 10 years it will still look contemporary and beautifully understated, not old and irrelevant."" [ 244 ] Motor Trend said the nose was controversial and polarizing, but probably intentionally so. [ 245 ] Vanity Fair and others compared the Model 3 to the Ford Model T for its intended affordability as a volume-produced electric vehicle. [ 246 ] [ 247 ] [ 248 ] Automotive journalist Doug DeMuro said the Model 3 was better, though $2,000 more expensive, than the BMW 340i and that it was the ""coolest car of the year,"" later clarifying that this was based on the ""long waiting lists, obsessive interest and news stories."" [ 249 ] Alex Roy said that DeMuro's review had concentrated on hardware details and missed out on the bigger picture. [ 248 ] Automotive-industry analyst Toni Sacconaghi of AllianceBernstein said after driving one of the early Tesla vehicles in November 2017 that ""Overall, we found the Model 3 to be a compelling offering, and believe it is likely to further galvanize the overall Electric Vehicle category."" He was less impressed with build quality of the test samples. ""Fit and finish on the two demo cars we saw—perhaps not surprisingly—was relatively poor."" He said that there were quality issues at first with the Model X which led to some concern. ""This is going to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand."" Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride quality, performance and interior space, and concluded that the 3 ""risks cannibalizing the [much more expensive] Model S going forward."" [ 250 ] Road & Track ' s Bob Sorokanich said the ""Model 3 proves that Tesla is thinking far beyond the edges of the Model S and X. Stepping out of the 3, you realize that, as far as the S and X pushed the envelope, they were always meant as intermediaries, stepping stones designed to draw people away from comfortable convention and into the future of the automobile. ... The Model 3 is Tesla at its most unabashed. It's an automaker finally willing to abandon the skeuomorphism of a false radiator grille, the tradition of a driver-oriented gauge panel."" [ 251 ] In 2018, a Model 3 was driven 606.2 mi (976 km) on a single charge, setting a hypermiling driving record. [ 252 ] In early 2019, Kelley Blue Book announced that the Tesla Model 3 was the winner of the ""Best Resale Value Award"" for all automobiles in the US market ""with a projected 69.3% resale value after 36 months and 48.7% after 60 months."" [ 253 ] Awards [ edit ] Popular Mechanics named the Tesla Model 3 as the magazine's 2018 Car of the Year. [ 254 ] Model 3 was given the 2018 Design of the Year award by Automobile magazine. [ 244 ] In the United Kingdom, the Model 3 was named 2019 Car of the Year by Auto Express magazine, [ 255 ] and 2020 Car of the Year by Parkers magazine, where it was also named ""Best Electric Car"" and ""Best Company Car"", and won the ""Best Safety"" award for any vehicle on the market. [ 256 ] The Model 3 won best mid-size car in the 2019 Das Goldene Lenkrad Golden Steering Wheel awards. [ 257 ] The Model 3 was named the top-rated electric car of 2019 by Edmunds.com , as well as being named Edmunds' top-rated Luxury Electric Vehicle for 2020. [ 258 ] [ 259 ] In late 2019, the Model 3 was also named a Top Safety Pick+ by the IIHS . [ 260 ] The Model 3 also won Car of the Year in Denmark, Car of the Year 2020 in Norway, and Swiss Car of the Year 2020. [ 261 ] The Model 3 was named as UK Car of the Year 2020 by a panel of 29 motoring journalists. The director of the awards stated that the car's ""technology, performance and range"" were converting opinions in favor of electric vehicles. [ 262 ] The car was chosen as one of the Top 10 Tech Cars by the IEEE in 2018. [ 263 ] In January 2021, the Model 3 Standard Range Plus was named Large Electric Car of the Year by What Car? magazine. [ 264 ] What Car? awarded the Model 3 five stars out of five in its review of the car. [ 265 ] In May 2021, the Model 3 won Auto Trader UK 's New Car Award for Best Car for Families. [ 266 ] Auto Trader awarded the Model 3 four and a half stars out of five in its review of the car. [ 267 ] In January 2024, the Model 3 RWD was awarded Executive Car of the Year by What Car? magazine. [ 268 ] [ 4 ] In January 2024, the Tesla Model 3 was awarded Mid-Size Company Car of the Year by Auto Express , recognizing its efficiency, advanced technology, and cost-effectiveness for businesses. [ 269 ] In 2025, the Tesla Model 3 was named Top Rated Electric Car by Edmunds , praised for its range, performance, advanced features, and overall driving experience. [ 270 ] Recalls [ edit ] In December 2021, 356,309 Model 3 vehicles built between 2017 and 2020 were recalled because of the possibility of damage to the rear view camera wiring harness caused by trunk operation. [ 271 ] In November 2022, Tesla recalled all vehicles for an over-the-air software update to remedy a condition where the tail lamps on one or both sides of the vehicle could work intermittently, making the vehicle less visible to others and increasing the risk of a crash. [ 272 ] In February 2023, Tesla recalled all vehicles equipped with the Full Self Driving Beta in the US and Canada for an over-the-air software update at the direction of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The agency said the system had allowed the vehicle to ""exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner [which] increases the risk of a crash."" Tesla opposed the federal request but ultimately complied. Elon Musk tweeted that the decision was, ""anachronistic and just flat wrong!"" U.S. senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the recall was, ""long overdue,"" adding, ""Tesla must finally stop overstating the real capabilities of its vehicles."" The fix, coming to a complete stop at stop signs rather than ~1 mph, was provided via an over-the-air software update. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] In December 2023, Tesla recalled all models with Autosteer (the lane centering part of Autopilot) in the US for an over-the-air software update that takes additional measures to ensure that the driver is paying attention. [ 275 ] Software version 2023.44.30 contains the remedy for the recall. [ 276 ] In January 2024, Tesla recalled all vehicles for an over-the-air software update that increased the font size of the visual warning indicators for brake, park, and antilock brake to the minimum required size of 3.2mm (1/8 inch). [ 277 ] In May 2024, Tesla recalled all vehicles in the US for an over-the-air software update to remedy a situation where the seat belt warning may not activate if there is an ""open trace in the driver seat occupancy switch"".  The software update became available in June 2024 and removes the dependency on the driver seat occupancy switch, using only the seat belt and ignition statuses to activate the warning. [ 278 ] In December 2024, Tesla recalled all vehicles for an over-the-air software update to resolve a condition where the tire pressure monitoring system may fail to provide adequate warnings. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] In January 2025, Tesla recalled some 2024–2025 Model 3 and Model S vehicles and some 2023–2025 Model X and Model Y vehicles for a software update to avoid shorting the car computer, preventing (among other things) the rear view camera from displaying. [ 281 ] Software releases 2024.44.25.3, 2024.44.25.6, or later contain changes to the power-up sequence. Computers that have been damaged need to be replaced under warranty to complete the remedy.

All-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment , also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank. Learn more about electric vehicles . High-res image Key Components of an All-Electric Car Battery (all-electric auxiliary): In an electric drive vehicle, the auxiliary battery provides electricity to power vehicle accessories. Charge port: The charge port allows the vehicle to connect to an external power supply in order to charge the traction battery pack. DC/DC converter: This device converts higher-voltage DC power from the traction battery pack to the lower-voltage DC power needed to run vehicle accessories and recharge the auxiliary battery. Electric traction motor: Using power from the traction battery pack, this motor drives the vehicle's wheels. Some vehicles use motor generators that perform both the drive and regeneration functions. Onboard charger: Takes the incoming AC electricity supplied via the charge port and converts it to DC power for charging the traction battery. It also communicates with the charging equipment and monitors battery characteristics such as voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge while charging the pack. Power electronics controller: This unit manages the flow of electrical energy delivered by the traction battery, controlling the speed of the electric traction motor and the torque it produces. Thermal system (cooling): This system maintains a proper operating temperature range of the engine, electric motor, power electronics, and other components. Traction battery pack: Stores electricity for use by the electric traction motor. Transmission (electric): The transmission transfers mechanical power from the electric traction motor to drive the wheels.

Here's a quick breakdown to help you decide: Upfront Costs : EVs cost $5,804 more on average in 2025, but federal tax credits (up to $7,500) can narrow the gap. Fuel/Charging : Charging an EV costs $500-$800 annually, while gas cars cost $2,000-$2,220 for fuel. Maintenance : EVs are 31% cheaper to maintain, with simpler mechanics and no oil changes. Insurance : EV insurance is 15% higher due to specialized parts. Resale Value : EVs are catching up, with premium models like Tesla holding value better. Quick Comparison Cost Factor EV (15 years) Gas (15 years) Upfront Costs Higher Lower Energy/Fuel $28,500 $35,460 Maintenance $5,400 $10,800 Insurance Higher Lower Resale Value Improving Competitive Bottom line : EVs save $7,000-$11,000 over 7-15 years, but gas cars might suit tighter budgets or rural drivers. Choose based on your driving habits, local energy costs, and financial goals. Electric Car vs Gas Costs: Which Truly Saves You The Most Money? 1. EV Ownership Costs Although electric vehicles (EVs) still cost an average of $5,804 more than gas-powered cars as of 2025 [6] , their ownership costs balance out over time. This is due to differences in upfront investment, daily operating costs, and long-term value retention. Purchase Price and Incentives The starting price for EVs begins at $32,875 for models like the Hyundai Kona Electric SE [9] . Federal tax credits of up to $7,500 [1] can significantly reduce the cost. For instance, the Chevrolet Equinox , priced at $41,100, could drop to $33,600 with these incentives [9] . Charging Costs Charging at home is the most affordable option for EV owners. Electricity costs between $0.12 and $0.24 per kWh, translating to $6-$18 for a full charge [1] . Public charging stations, though pricier at around $0.30 per kWh, are convenient for road trips. On average, EV owners who primarily charge at home spend $500 to $800 annually on electricity [2] . Charging Type Cost per kWh Full Charge Cost Home Charging $0.12-$0.24 $6-$18 Public Charging $0.30+ $20-$40 Annual Cost (Home) N/A $500-$800 Maintenance Expenses EVs cost less to maintain compared to gas vehicles, with average yearly expenses of $949 versus $1,279 for gas cars [1] . That’s a 31% reduction [7] , largely due to simpler mechanics and no need for oil changes or spark plug replacements. However, regular upkeep like tire rotations and brake maintenance is still required. Insurance Costs Insurance for EVs tends to be higher because of specialized parts and repairs. Full coverage can range from $2,007 per year for a Chevy Bolt to $4,364 for a Tesla Model X [1] . Value Retention Resale values for EVs are improving, particularly for premium models like the Tesla Model 3 , which hold their value better than average [2] . Additionally, most EVs come with battery warranties that cover 8-10 years or 100,000-150,000 miles [7] , offering peace of mind and reducing potential long-term repair costs. These factors create a distinct financial picture for EV ownership compared to gas vehicles, which we’ll explore further in the next section. sbb-itb-66f4901 2. Gas Car Ownership Costs Owning a gas-powered vehicle often means a lower upfront price but comes with recurring expenses that add up over time. These costs create unique financial challenges compared to owning an EV, especially in the following areas: Purchase Price and Depreciation The starting price for new gas-powered vehicles varies widely. Compact SUVs begin at $21,495, while larger SUVs range from $57,520 to $82,690 [7] . These vehicles lose about 15-20% of their value annually in the first few years [3] . However, certain models, like the Toyota Camry , tend to hold their value better. While EVs are seeing improvements in resale value, premium gas models remain competitive. Fuel Costs Gas prices significantly impact ownership costs. With an average price of $3.70 per gallon and fuel efficiency of 25 mpg, drivers covering 15,000 miles a year spend around $2,220 annually on fuel - three to four times more than the cost of charging an EV. Cost Category Annual Expense Fuel $2,000-$2,220 Maintenance Needs Gas vehicles require regular maintenance, which increases their annual costs by about 35% compared to EVs. Essential services include: Oil changes : $35-$75 every three months Tire rotations : $20-$50 twice a year Brake servicing : $150-$300 per axle every 3-5 years Insurance Costs Insurance for gas cars averages $1,900 annually, about 15% less than EV insurance. This difference is largely due to the well-established repair networks for gas-powered vehicles. Unexpected Repairs Gas cars are more prone to unpredictable repair costs, especially as they age. Common expenses include: Catalytic converter replacement: $1,000-$2,500 Transmission service: $80-$250 every 30,000-60,000 miles Major engine repairs after the warranty period [3] These factors highlight the ongoing financial responsibilities of owning a gas-powered vehicle, making it essential to weigh these costs against the benefits. Direct Comparison: EV vs Gas A 2025 study analyzing 15-year ownership costs highlights financial trends between electric and gas-powered vehicles across key expense categories. Purchase and Initial Costs The price difference between electric and gas vehicles is shrinking. By December 2024, the average cost of a new electric car was $55,544, compared to the overall new car average of $49,740 [8] . Long-Term Cost Comparison Examining costs over 15 years and 180,000 miles reveals notable differences: Cost Factor EV (15 yrs) Gas (15 yrs) Energy $28,500 $35,460 Maintenance $5,400 $10,800 Total $71,460 $79,704 Energy Efficiency and Fuel Savings Electric cars are 2.6 to 4.8 times more energy-efficient than their gas counterparts. This efficiency leads to considerable fuel savings in most driving scenarios. Regional Cost Variations Electricity rates play a big role in operational costs. For instance, in Washington state, where electricity is $0.10/kWh, EVs cost 80% less to run than gas vehicles. In California, with higher rates at $0.27/kWh, the savings drop to 40% [4] [5] . Additional Considerations Some costs often overlooked include installing a home charger ($500-$2,000) and potential battery replacements after the warranty period ($5,000-$15,000). However, these expenses rarely outweigh the long-term savings [2] [7] . Taking all factors into account, EV owners typically save between $7,000 and $11,000 over a 7-15 year period [2] . Conclusion Electric vehicles (EVs) often offer lower long-term costs, especially for drivers who can take full advantage of their efficiency. According to the Department of Energy 's Vehicle Cost Calculator, a driver covering 15,000 miles per year can save about $1,000 annually on fuel costs compared to a gas-powered car [1] [2] . When considering these savings, EVs tend to be a better fit for high-mileage drivers and urban commuters. On the other hand, gas cars might work better for rural drivers or those managing tighter budgets. For a more tailored cost analysis, tools like the EPA 's Fuel Economy Website or Edmunds True Cost to Own® calculator can help. These tools take into account factors like local electricity rates and individual driving habits [7] [8] . One of the biggest ongoing advantages of EVs is their lower maintenance costs, averaging around $330 per year [1] . To see how this aligns with your financial goals, use the tools mentioned above for detailed estimates. What's your car worth?

Starting June 25, Hyundai will suspend output on a line at its Ulsan Plant dedicated to building the IONIQ 5 and Kona Electric. Why is Hyundai halting EV production in Korea again? After pausing production at its Ulsan Plant 1 in Korea in February, April, and May , Hyundai is set to do it again in June. According to industry sources, Hyundai will halt production on Line 2 at its Ulsan Plant 1, which produces IONIQ 5 and Kona EV models. The suspension begins on Wednesday, June 25, and will last for only three days, ending on June 27. Although some believe it’s a sign of slowing demand for electric vehicles, Hyundai may simply be adjusting its inventory. Advertisement - scroll for more content Like most of the industry, the Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, is competing for its share of the global market against low-cost competitors like BYD, which is quickly expanding overseas. The news comes after a report on Wednesday claimed BYD is also slowing production in China. Exports of the popular IONIQ 5 declined 69% last month to 2,449 units, down from nearly 8,000 in May 2024. Kona EV exports also fell sharply to 234 units, representing an 83.3% decrease from last year. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 (Source: Hyundai) In Europe, Hyundai and Kia’s vehicle registrations are down 5%through May compared to the same period last year. Although Hyundai and Kia’s exports to the US were down 21.5% last month to 77,892 units, it’s likely due to local production coming online. Hyundai IONIQ 9 (Source: Hyundai) Hyundai celebrated the grand opening of its massive new EV plant in Georgia earlier this year, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). Hyundai has been building the new 2025 IONIQ 5 at the facility since last year, while its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, joined it in March. The new facility is capable of producing up to 300,000 vehicles a year, but capacity could be expanded to around 500,000 if needed. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 at a Tesla Supercharger (Source: Hyundai) Hyundai’s electric vehicles remain among the most affordable and efficient EVs available in the US. The new 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 starts at $60,555 with a range of up to 335 miles. Like the new IONIQ 5, Hyundai’s three-row electric SUV features a built-in NACS port, allowing it to charge at Tesla Superchargers. The upgraded 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5, now with a range of up to 318 miles and an improved style both inside and out, starts at $42,500. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 Trim EV Powertrain Driving Range (miles) Starting Price* Monthly lease price June 2025 IONIQ 5 SE RWD Standard Range 168-horsepower rear motor 245 $42,500 $179 IONIQ 5 SE RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $46,550 $199 IONIQ 5 SEL RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $49,500 $209 IONIQ 5 Limited RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $54,200 $309 IONIQ 5 SE Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 290 $50,050 $249 IONIQ 5 SEL Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 290 $53,000 $259 IONIQ 5 XRT Dual Motor  AWD 320 horsepower dual motor 259 $55,400 $359 IONIQ 5 Limited Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 269 $58,100 $299 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 prices and range by trim (*includes $1,475 destination fee) After Hyundai cut lease prices last month, you can now snag the 2025 IONIQ 5 for as little as $179 per month. The IONIQ 9 is listed for lease starting at $419 per month. Both are still eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, as long as it remains in effect. To throw in a little extra, Hyundai is offering a free ChargePoint Home Flex Level 2 charger with the purchase of any new 2026 IONIQ 9 or 2025 IONIQ 5. Looking to test one out for yourself?

Gallery Show all photos Much of the attention on electric vehicles (EVs) is currently centred on battery technology and range. Solid-state batteries provide an answer to most of the issues that plague today’s EVs, but they are still a few years away from being viable for mass production. Batteries are important, but motors are just as crucial to an electric car. They are the engine of an EV and its only source of propulsion. Most new EVs today are equipped with one or more electric motors that use permanent magnets in their construction. Permanent magnet motors are quieter, more efficient, and provide greater torque at low speeds than alternative technologies. They are an easy choice for automakers, but permanent magnets are made with rare earth metals, which poses some issues, according to Dr. Ali Emadi, CEO and founder of Enedym, a McMaster University-based startup specializing in rare earth-free electric motors. The Problems with Rare Earths “Over 84 per cent of the global supply of rare earths are mined in China,” he says. “[Rare earth metals] have become a critical part of the global",N,Y,N

Peter Johnson | Jun 25 2025 - 2:59 pm PT 15 Comments The Honda Prologue continues to surprise, ranking among the top ten most leased vehicles (gas-powered or EV) in the US in the first quarter. It was the only EV, outside of Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3, that made the list. Honda Prologue EV is one of the most leased vehicles After launching the Prologue in the US last March, Honda’s electric SUV took off. In the second half of the year, it was the second-best-selling electric SUV , trailing only the Tesla Model Y. The Prologue remains a top-selling EV in the US this year, with over 13,500 units sold through May. That’s not too bad, considering it only sold 705 through May of last year. According to a new Experian report (via Automotive News ), Honda’s success is being driven by ultra-affordable lease rates. In the first quarter, nearly 60% of new EV buyers in the US chose to lease, up from just 36% a year ago. Advertisement - scroll for more content Three EVs ranked in the top ten most leased vehicles in Q1, including the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, and Honda Prologue. 2025 Honda Prologue Elite (Source: Honda) Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 took the top two spots, while the Honda Prologue ranked number seven. Those who leased Tesla’s Model 3 paid $402 per month, Honda Prologue lessees paid $486 a month. Given the average loan rate was $708 a month for those who bought it, it’s no wonder nearly 90% chose to lease. Under 9% chose to buy, while less than 2% paid cash. 2025 Honda Prologue Elite interior (Source: Honda) The discounts are piling up, but for how long? To give you a better idea, the average monthly payment for a new vehicle lease in the US in the first quarter was $595. With over $20,000 in discounts, Honda’s luxury Acura brand is selling a surprising number of EVs in the US. The nearly $65,000 Acura ZDX is sold for under $40,000 on average in May, according to Cox Automotive’s EV Market Monitor report for May. 2024 Acura ZDX (Source: Acura The trend is primarily thanks to the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which is being passed on to customers through leasing. With the Trump administration and Senate Republicans aiming to kill off federal subsidies, the savings could soon disappear. If the Senate’s recently proposed bill is passed, the $7,500 credit would expire within 180 days. It would not only make electric vehicles more expensive, but it would also put the US further behind China and others leading the shift to electrification. 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT (Source: GM) Some automakers, including GM, are expected to continue offering the incentives. “GM has been very competitive on the incentives on their end, and that is not scheduled to end.” After outselling Ford, GM’s Chevy is now the fastest-growing EV brand in the US through May. Chevy is starting to chip away at Tesla’s lead, largely thanks to the new Equinox EV, or “America’s most affordable +315 range EV,” as GM calls it. 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV RS (Source: GM) According to Xperian , those who leased a new Chevy Equinox EV in Q1 paid $243 less than those who financed it. The electric Equinox stood out in Cox Automotive’s EV Market Monitor report with an average selling price under $40,000, even without incentives. The Chevy Equinox EV remains one of the most affordable EVs on the market. Starting at just $34,995, the base LT FWD model offers an EPA-estimated range of 319 miles. After Hyundai cut lease prices earlier this month, the 2025 IONIQ 5 might just take the cake. You can now lease the 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 (now with a built-in NACS port) for as low as $179 per month. Looking to test out some of the most popular EVs for yourself?

Discover used BMW models on Kijiji Autos's large inventory of car listings in your area. Used BMW 3-Series highlights The last generation ran from 2012 to 2018, and was offered in three body styles: sedan, convertible and coupe—the sports wagon joined the lineup in 2014. The sedan model is available as two or four doors. True to the brand's reputation, these models are equipped with robust engine options and high-end interiors that are designed for convenience. Apple CarPlay and a wireless charger were introduced to the BMW 3-Series models in 2017.

It’s easy to see out of, undemanding and consumes long journeys with ease and in spectacular comfort. The massage seats are some of the best we’ve ever come across. Irrelevant?

It drives just as well as its cousins, has a less annoying, more practical interior (particularly compared to the ID.4) and costs around the same or less than its sibling rivals. Best try all three before you commit to buying, but we know where we’d spend our money.” Read the full Skoda Enyaq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Polestar 2 “We love the Polestar 2 because it’s handsome, the build quality will give Audi drivers PTSD, and there’s a real sense of humility about the car.

Single Motor iterations make it more accessible for most too.” Read the full Polestar 2 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV6 “Distinctive yet unlikely to fall off a fashion cliff, rapid in a straight line but not dynamic enough to worry a proper sports car, the EV6 carves a very different path to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 with which it shares bones and blood. And that's no bad thing. But it's also spacious, quiet and a very capable cruiser, and equipped with that 800-volt architecture that makes charging station stops quick and painless. It's one of those cars that makes you think other countries are one step behind compared to what South Korea has to offer.” Read the full Kia EV6 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk BMW i5 Touring “The first all-electric executive-sized estate to the market. How did Avant kings Audi let that happen? While the four-ringed team has been asleep at the wheel, BMW has snuck in and delivered a choice of rear- or dual-motor electric luxe with a 570-litre boot. It’s refined, comfortable, easy to drive, swift, and almost too well-equipped for its own good.” Read the full BMW i5 Touring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Audi A6 Avant e-tron “We like the A6 e-tron, not least for the fact that it’s not an SUV. How refreshing. Beyond that it fulfils its brief well, carves cleanly through the air and travels a long way between charges. It’s a handsome machine that doesn’t try too hard to be an aero car, is super-smooth and refined and drives much like the big Audi saloons you’ve seen before.” Read the full Audi A6 Avant e-tron review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Renault Megane E-Tech Electric “This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it. Which is more than can be said of the ID.3.” Read the full Renault Megane Electric review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Macan “Porsche hasn’t dulled the Macan’s sheen with the switch to electric. If you want an incredibly well-rounded daily to deal with everyday life, the Macan stands out. It’s fast, comfortable, well-made and eminently practical - even more so than the ICE versions - and in Turbo form it’ll stay with a serious sportscar. “The main thrust is really the breadth of ability rather than one big headline; a comfy car in town with enough handling finesse to make it fun on a twisty bit of road. Where other mid-sized electric SUVs run out of ideas, the Macan gets going. It’s not cheap, but an absolutely solid effort from Porsche, and best-in-class.” Read the full Porsche Macan review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Fiat Grande Panda “The Grande Panda is an excellently low-cost and practical supermini – petrol or electric – with pretty special design. In a world where superminis are getting very little love from the manufacturers, that's a win. “The general aspect nods towards crossovers, and the detailing is heartwarming and original. All of which applied to the original Panda in 1980. This is a return for Fiat to doing what it has always done best.” Read the full Fiat Grande Panda review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Dacia Spring “The Spring’s appeal is that it’s everything that many electric cars aren’t: it’s not over-wrought or heavy-handed, it’s honest and enjoyable and manages to keep the dream of a low impact electric car alive and proves to everyone else it is possible for a battery electric vehicle to weigh largely the same as its petrol equivalent. Well done Dacia, let’s hope that where you lead, others will follow.” Read the full Dacia Spring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Skoda Elroq “The Skoda Elroq follows closely in the Enyaq’s footsteps, and for good reason. That car proved better than either of its VW Group siblings, and the Elroq - debuting Skoda’s new language - looks even smarter. It drives equally as well, and is just as competitively priced too. it oozes Skoda sensibility and will no doubt have competitors glancing nervously in its direction.” Read the full Skoda Elroq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Volvo EX30 “The audited CO2 footprint of a base-model EX30 out of the factory is only 18 tonnes; not much more than many petrol rivals. The UK electricity it uses to drive for an 8,000-mile year emits about 0.4 tonnes of power-station CO2, where a petrol car would emit 1.8 tonnes from its exhaust. So the EX30's lifetime CO2 is about half that of a petrol.” Read the full Volvo EX30 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV3 “The EV3 is just so roundly, crushingly competent in the same way a Golf used to be. Keenly priced and promising not to depreciate like a dropped ice lolly on a beach. Easy going and comfy to drive. Right-sized for families and not too bloated to park. It’s a roundly thought-out bit of kit as a ‘car’. And it doesn’t trip up when you factor in the ‘electric’ bit – adequate performance, strong range, and the ability to accept a speedy recharge. Not a given in an entry-level EV.” Read the full Kia EV3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk MG4 “On the face of it, the MG4 doesn’t seem like a very exciting car - certainly not something Top Gear would give a massively high score to. But when you dig into what it does for the money, how high it scores on multiple levels, it’s probably the only car in the class to recommend. It’s got range, charging, equipment, zippy dynamics and now some style.” Read the full MG4 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Tesla Model 3 / Tesla Model Y “This is the future we were promised – a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.” Read the full Tesla Model 3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk “A massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they’ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it’s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone.” Read the full Tesla Model Y review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Taycan “The Taycan can absolutely entertain on the right road and is a delight to cruise in - a GT with the heart of a sports car.

It’s still a galloping, ocean-going, 24-carat indulgence, but with a tasteful specification it’s just about possible to swerve absolute vulgarity. “It’s rich in the decadence of the so-called glory days but gratifyingly simple to operate for a product of 2023. While other manufacturers wrestle with the conundrum of transposing their family heirloom values into an electric future, the age of electric propulsion will suit Rolls-Royce very well indeed.” Read the full Rolls-Royce Spectre review Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Hyundai Ioniq 5 N “Right now, the Ioniq 5 N is an electric car that's as involving as a really good petrol car. In some ways it does that by brazenly impersonating a petrol drivetrain. The surprising thng is that's absolutely not just a gimmick. “Then in corners it has some original tricks of its own. It's not just fast, it's confident and playful so it's fun even when it's not going fast. It's useful and versatile too. “So it has many of the talents you expect from an electric car, and many more that so far are unique in EVs. Which makes us call it a new and brilliant chapter.” Read the full Hyundai Ioniq 5 N review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Renault 5 “The R5’s not the first premium-retro EV. It shares with the Mini and Fiat 500 a knowing silhouette, lavish external jewellery and a smart, cheery cabin. But it’s bigger than a Fiat 500 and goes further, and it's more practical than the Mini and copes better with bumpy roads. “It's not the cheapest EV either. But looking at performance and range, it's right in the sweet spot, and the bi-directional charging could help subsidise you outlay. Most of all it feels consistent: as charming to drive as it is to look at and to sit in. Your first love should last.” Read the full Renault 5 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Looking for more from the USA?

Volvo has shared new information about the upcoming EX60, its midsize electric SUV, including when we can expect to see it for the first time. When will Volvo launch the EX60 midsize electric SUV? We knew it was coming soon, but not this soon. After teasing the new EV on its social media this week, Volvo confirmed the EX60 will make its debut in early 2026. Volvo’s teaser image reveals a new vertical rear taillight design and the EX60 emblem on the back, accompanied by the caption “a midsize SUV designed to evolve with you.” Unlike most new EVs launching nowadays, there does not appear to be a full-length light bar across the rear. The new EX60 will be the first vehicle to ride on Volvo’s advanced new SPA3 platform. Based on its Superset tech stack, Volvo calls it “a true game changer” that will enable the vehicle to continuously improve over time. Advertisement - scroll for more content Volvo said the biggest advantage of the new platform is its flexibility. The new EV architecture can support “cars of all sizes – larger than the EX90 and smaller than the EX30 – using the same technology base.” Volvo teases the new EX60, a midsize electric SUV (Source: Volvo Cars) Although the company has yet to release official specs, you can expect it to be around the same size as the XC60, which has a length of 4,708 mm (185.4″), a width of 1,902 mm (74.9″), and a height of 1,655 mm (65.2″). Other design features expected include Volvo’s new Thor Hammer LED headlights, a closed-off grille, and flush door handles. Volvo has yet to confirm whether the EX60 will feature a LiDAR driver assist system, similar to the larger EX90 electric SUV. However, Erik Severinson, chief product and strategy officer at Volvo Cars, told Auto Express last year that the company is looking into “different kinds of sensors going forward.” Volvo EX90 (Source: Volvo) The EX60 will feature a structural battery pack, similar to those used by Tesla and BYD, to enhance efficiency. Given that the EX90 uses a 107 kWh battery pack, good for 374 miles range, you can expect the EX60 to arrive with a slightly smaller, lighter battery. Volvo also announced earlier this week that the new midsize electric SUV will be the first vehicle to debut with its new  multi-adaptive safety belt. Check back soon for more info leading up to the EX60’s global debut in early 2026. We’ll keep you updated with the latest. Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

Electricity Basics Benefits & Considerations Stations Vehicles Laws & Incentives Electric Vehicle Benefits and Considerations All forms of electric vehicles (EVs) can help improve fuel economy, lower fuel costs, and reduce emissions. Using electricity as a power source for transportation improves public health and the environment, and provides safety benefits, and contributes to a resilient transportation system. Public Health and the Environment The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. A successful transition to clean transportation will require various vehicle and fuel solutions and must consider life cycle emissions. Electric and hybrid vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) produce no tailpipe emissions when operating in all-electric mode. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) emissions benefits vary by vehicle model and type of hybrid power system. The life cycle emissions of an electric vehicle depend on the source of the electricity used to charge it, which varies by region. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity production , electric vehicles typically have a life cycle emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on conventional electricity generation, electric vehicles may not demonstrate a strong life cycle emissions benefit. Use the Electricity Sources and Emissions Tool to compare life cycle emissions of individual vehicle models in a given location. Batteries The advanced batteries in electric vehicles are designed for extended life but will wear out eventually. Several manufacturers of electric vehicles are offering 8-year/100,000-mile battery warranties. Predictive modeling by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicates that today’s batteries may last 12 to 15 years in moderate climates (8 to 12 years in extreme climates). In addition to climate, other factors impacting battery life include driving and charging patterns, battery cell chemistry and design, and the vehicle-battery-environment thermal system. Check with your dealer for model-specific information about battery life and warranties. Although manufacturers have not published pricing for replacement batteries, some are offering extended warranty programs with monthly fees. If the batteries need to be replaced outside the warranty, it may be a significant expense. Battery prices are expected to continue declining as battery technologies improve and production volumes increase. Costs Although energy costs for EVs are generally lower than for similar conventional vehicles, purchase prices can be significantly higher. Prices are likely to equalize with conventional vehicles, as production volumes increase and battery technologies continue to mature. Also, initial costs can be offset by fuel cost savings, federal tax credits , and state and utility incentives . The federal Clean Vehicle Tax Credits are available are available to consumers, fleets, businesses, and tax-exempt entities investing in new, used, and commercial clean vehicles—including all-electric vehicles, PHEVs, fuel cell EVs—and EV charging infrastructure. Some states and electric utilities also offer incentives, many of which can be found in the Laws and Incentives database . For more information on available incentives, connect with your local Clean Cities and Communities coalition . Use the Vehicle Cost Calculator to compare lifetime ownership costs of individual models of electric vehicles and conventional vehicles. Fuel Economy Electric vehicles can reduce fuel costs dramatically because of the high efficiency of electric-drive components. Because all-electric vehicles and PHEVs rely in whole or part on electric power, their fuel economy is measured differently than that of conventional vehicles. Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPGe) and kilowatt-hours (kWh) per 100 miles are common metrics. Depending on how they are driven, today's light-duty all-electric vehicles (or PHEVs in electric mode) can exceed 130 MPGe and can drive 100 miles consuming only 25–40 kWh. HEVs typically achieve better fuel economy and have lower fuel costs than similar conventional vehicles. For example, FuelEconomy.gov lists the 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid at an EPA combined city-and-highway fuel economy estimate of 50 miles per gallon (MPG), while the estimate for the conventional 2024 Corolla (four cylinder, automatic) is 35 MPG. Use the Find A Car tool on FuelEconomy.gov to compare fuel economy ratings of individual hybrid and conventional models. The fuel economy of medium- and heavy-duty all-electric vehicles and PHEVs is highly dependent on the load carried and the duty cycle, but in the right applications, all-electric vehicles maintain a strong fuel-to-cost advantage over their conventional counterparts. Infrastructure Availability All-electric vehicles and PHEVs have the benefit of flexible charging because the electric grid is near most locations where people park. To safely deliver energy from the electric grid to a vehicle’s battery, an EV charging station, sometimes referred to as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is needed. Drivers can charge overnight at a residence , including multifamily housing , as well as the workplace or a public charging station when available. PHEVs have added flexibility because they can also refuel with gasoline or diesel (or possibly other fuels in the future) when necessary. Public charging stations are not as ubiquitous as gas stations. Charging equipment manufacturers, automakers, utilities, Clean Cities and Communities coalitions, states, municipalities, and government agencies are rapidly establishing a national network of public charging stations. The number of publicly accessible charging stations in the United States reached more than 60,000 in 2024, offering more than 162,000 charging ports , according to the Alternative Fueling Station Locator . Search for electric charging stations near you. Energy Security and Resilience The transportation sector accounts for approximately 30% of total U.S. energy needs and 70% of U.S. petroleum consumption. Using more energy efficient vehicles like hybrid and electric vehicles supports the U.S. economy and helps diversify the U.S. transportation fleet. The multiple fuel sources used to generate electricity results in a more secure energy source for the electrified portion of the transportation sector. All of this strengthens national energy security by increasing resilience to natural disasters and fuel supply disruptions. HEVs typically use less fuel than similar conventional vehicles because they employ electric-drive technologies to boost vehicle efficiency through regenerative braking—recapturing energy otherwise lost during braking. PHEVs and all-electric vehicles, also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), are both capable of being powered solely by electricity, which is produced in the United States from natural gas, coal, nuclear energy, wind energy, hydropower, and solar energy.

Two-door coupes are often highly compact vehicles and, because of their low weight, they can offer great fuel economy. Driving a coupe Coupes tend to be lower to the ground and lighter than other models; which helps them achieve better maneuverability and lower drag – features that add to the overall fuel efficiency of this type of vehicle. Just like their four-door cousins, the two-door coupe employs all of the electronic safety and handling systems available in their line. These features do, however, come at a price. Features and engines When shopping for a two-door coupe, you will see standards such as; ABS brakes, stability control, traction control, brake assist, active cruise control and a blind spot monitor to help keep you safe. Power choices run from small, turbo-charged four-cylinder engines up to fire-breathing twin turbo V6 powerplants. Test it out These sporty vehicles can be available with manual transmissions, adding to the enjoyment for some drivers. Automatic transmissions are, however, more common. When you are considering buying a coupe, be sure to take it on a test-drive. If you a",Y,N,N

It’s easy to see out of, undemanding and consumes long journeys with ease and in spectacular comfort. The massage seats are some of the best we’ve ever come across. Irrelevant? Not if you’re a parent. Little luxuries help assuage the squabbling in the back.

It drives just as well as its cousins, has a less annoying, more practical interior (particularly compared to the ID.4) and costs around the same or less than its sibling rivals. Best try all three before you commit to buying, but we know where we’d spend our money.” Read the full Skoda Enyaq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Polestar 2 “We love the Polestar 2 because it’s handsome, the build quality will give Audi drivers PTSD, and there’s a real sense of humility about the car. It’s been designed to work seamlessly, not to wow you with gimmicks then wind you up further down the line. Single Motor iterations make it more accessible for most too.” Read the full Polestar 2 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV6 “Distinctive yet unlikely to fall off a fashion cliff, rapid in a straight line but not dynamic enough to worry a proper sports car, the EV6 carves a very different path to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 with which it shares bones and blood. And that's no bad thing. But it's also spacious, quiet and a very capable cruiser, and equipped with that 800-volt architecture that makes charging station stops quick and painless. It's one of those cars that makes you think other countries are one step behind compared to what South Korea has to offer.” Read the full Kia EV6 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk BMW i5 Touring “The first all-electric executive-sized estate to the market. How did Avant kings Audi let that happen? While the four-ringed team has been asleep at the wheel, BMW has snuck in and delivered a choice of rear- or dual-motor electric luxe with a 570-litre boot. It’s refined, comfortable, easy to drive, swift, and almost too well-equipped for its own good.” Read the full BMW i5 Touring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Audi A6 Avant e-tron “We like the A6 e-tron, not least for the fact that it’s not an SUV. How refreshing. Beyond that it fulfils its brief well, carves cleanly through the air and travels a long way between charges. It’s a handsome machine that doesn’t try too hard to be an aero car, is super-smooth and refined and drives much like the big Audi saloons you’ve seen before.” Read the full Audi A6 Avant e-tron review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Renault Megane E-Tech Electric “This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it. Which is more than can be said of the ID.3.” Read the full Renault Megane Electric review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Macan “Porsche hasn’t dulled the Macan’s sheen with the switch to electric. If you want an incredibly well-rounded daily to deal with everyday life, the Macan stands out. It’s fast, comfortable, well-made and eminently practical - even more so than the ICE versions - and in Turbo form it’ll stay with a serious sportscar. “The main thrust is really the breadth of ability rather than one big headline; a comfy car in town with enough handling finesse to make it fun on a twisty bit of road. Where other mid-sized electric SUVs run out of ideas, the Macan gets going. It’s not cheap, but an absolutely solid effort from Porsche, and best-in-class.” Read the full Porsche Macan review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Fiat Grande Panda “The Grande Panda is an excellently low-cost and practical supermini – petrol or electric – with pretty special design. In a world where superminis are getting very little love from the manufacturers, that's a win. “The general aspect nods towards crossovers, and the detailing is heartwarming and original. All of which applied to the original Panda in 1980. This is a return for Fiat to doing what it has always done best.” Read the full Fiat Grande Panda review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Dacia Spring “The Spring’s appeal is that it’s everything that many electric cars aren’t: it’s not over-wrought or heavy-handed, it’s honest and enjoyable and manages to keep the dream of a low impact electric car alive and proves to everyone else it is possible for a battery electric vehicle to weigh largely the same as its petrol equivalent. Well done Dacia, let’s hope that where you lead, others will follow.” Read the full Dacia Spring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Skoda Elroq “The Skoda Elroq follows closely in the Enyaq’s footsteps, and for good reason. That car proved better than either of its VW Group siblings, and the Elroq - debuting Skoda’s new language - looks even smarter. It drives equally as well, and is just as competitively priced too. it oozes Skoda sensibility and will no doubt have competitors glancing nervously in its direction.” Read the full Skoda Elroq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Volvo EX30 “The audited CO2 footprint of a base-model EX30 out of the factory is only 18 tonnes; not much more than many petrol rivals. The UK electricity it uses to drive for an 8,000-mile year emits about 0.4 tonnes of power-station CO2, where a petrol car would emit 1.8 tonnes from its exhaust. So the EX30's lifetime CO2 is about half that of a petrol.” Read the full Volvo EX30 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV3 “The EV3 is just so roundly, crushingly competent in the same way a Golf used to be. Keenly priced and promising not to depreciate like a dropped ice lolly on a beach. Easy going and comfy to drive. Right-sized for families and not too bloated to park. It’s a roundly thought-out bit of kit as a ‘car’. And it doesn’t trip up when you factor in the ‘electric’ bit – adequate performance, strong range, and the ability to accept a speedy recharge. Not a given in an entry-level EV.” Read the full Kia EV3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk MG4 “On the face of it, the MG4 doesn’t seem like a very exciting car - certainly not something Top Gear would give a massively high score to. But when you dig into what it does for the money, how high it scores on multiple levels, it’s probably the only car in the class to recommend. It’s got range, charging, equipment, zippy dynamics and now some style.” Read the full MG4 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Tesla Model 3 / Tesla Model Y “This is the future we were promised – a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.” Read the full Tesla Model 3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk “A massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they’ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it’s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone.” Read the full Tesla Model Y review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Taycan “The Taycan can absolutely entertain on the right road and is a delight to cruise in - a GT with the heart of a sports car. More importantly, it’s a proper Porsche that just happens to run on electricity.” Read the full Porsche Taycan review , the full Taycan Cross Turismo review and the full Sport Turismo review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Rolls-Royce Spectre “Electric has enriched the Rolls-Royce. It’s still a galloping, ocean-going, 24-carat indulgence, but with a tasteful specification it’s just about possible to swerve absolute vulgarity. “It’s rich in the decadence of the so-called glory days but gratifyingly simple to operate for a product of 2023. While other manufacturers wrestle with the conundrum of transposing their family heirloom values into an electric future, the age of electric propulsion will suit Rolls-Royce very well indeed.” Read the full Rolls-Royce Spectre review Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Hyundai Ioniq 5 N “Right now, the Ioniq 5 N is an electric car that's as involving as a really good petrol car. In some ways it does that by brazenly impersonating a petrol drivetrain. The surprising thng is that's absolutely not just a gimmick. “Then in corners it has some original tricks of its own. It's not just fast, it's confident and playful so it's fun even when it's not going fast. It's useful and versatile too. “So it has many of the talents you expect from an electric car, and many more that so far are unique in EVs. Which makes us call it a new and brilliant chapter.” Read the full Hyundai Ioniq 5 N review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Renault 5 “The R5’s not the first premium-retro EV. It shares with the Mini and Fiat 500 a knowing silhouette, lavish external jewellery and a smart, cheery cabin. But it’s bigger than a Fiat 500 and goes further, and it's more practical than the Mini and copes better with bumpy roads. “It's not the cheapest EV either. But looking at performance and range, it's right in the sweet spot, and the bi-directional charging could help subsidise you outlay. Most of all it feels consistent: as charming to drive as it is to look at and to sit in. Your first love should last.” Read the full Renault 5 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Looking for more from the USA?

Gallery Show all 8 photos The Canadian automotive market has always been influenced by the United States. As our closest neighbour, naturally, many American products make it over the border. In the 1950s, however, Canada imposed a 35 per cent tariff on foreign vehicles, including those from the U.S. This resulted in U.S. manufacturers using Canadian-only brands to bypass these tariffs. These brands mostly consisted of badge-engineered models, or models made by one brand, and sold under a second brand as a different car. Most of these Canadian cars were already sold in the United States but were produced locally, with only a few minor changes. Because of this, Canada was host to a bunch of regionally exclusive cars that are now largely forgotten. Many of these brands ended following the introduction of the Auto Pact , which axed the import tariffs, and the U.S. brought more manufacturing to Canada. As a result, there was no longer a need for these odd Canadian brands because American models could be sold freely in the Canadian market. Meteor In the 1950s, Ford sold all its brands (Ford,",N,N,N

Gallery Show all 22 photos BMW is turning the dial up to 11 on the 2 Series with the even higher-performance M2 CS. With a healthy dose of extra power, new aero elements, and improved driving dynamics, the new trim will be drifting into dealerships later this summer. The automaker turned to its racing division to make improvements to the M2’s 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. An extremely rigid crank case, a lightweight forged crankshaft, and a wire-arc sprayed iron coating in the cylinder bores — among other go-fast upgrades — all result in an engine that can pump out 523 hp, a 50 hp bump over the standard M2. The car also makes 479 lb-ft of torque between 2,700 and 5,620 rpm — that’s 36 lb-ft more than the non CS model, and it’s available over a wider portion of the rev range. That should make the M2 CS feel lightning quick and will make its power more readily available t",N,N,N

To remedy this, manufacturers need to revisit the days of the Model T. Photograph: Andre Tillmann/ Mercedes-Benz AG Save this story Save Save this story Save It may well be able to wade through deep water, have crawl-assist mode for sketchy terrain, and even perform 360-degree swivel-on-the-spot tank turns, but sales of the seemingly much-anticipated electric Mercedes G-Class SUV have been poor. Actually, that’s an understatement. They’ve been woeful. And it’s not the only e-flop from a legacy automaker: Just last week Ferrari announced that it is delaying its second EV model (the first will arrive in October) until at least 2028 because of weak demand . Porsche has cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of its electric Macan SUV and Taycan models. Indeed, depreciation on the Taycan is so eye-watering that some Porsche dealers have supposedly refused to take their own brand’s performance EV from owners looking to offload or upgrade. And after the February closure of its Belgian factory , Audi’s Q8 E-tron has been discontinued . The shuttering of the Brussels plant, says Audi , was due to a “global decline in customer orders in the electric luxury class segment.” Yet, at the same time, global sales of EVs are going gangbusters—so what gives? Audi’s Q8 E-tron has been discontinued following a “global decline in customer orders in the electric luxury class segment.” Photograph: AUDI AG “The transition to EVs is not just a case of putting a battery in a vehicle,” says Peter Wells, a business professor and director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, UK. “Large premium EVs require very large batteries to match anything like the performance of typical ICE versions, and this increases their price.” Indeed, the all-electric G-Wagen will set you back a staggering $162,000. The full EV Range Rover coming later this year is expected to cost even more, supposedly retailing for upwards of $180,000. “For years, brands like Porsche, Audi, and others have been able to expand output and model ranges while continuing to command premium prices in the market. Those days are now over,” says Wells. Mercedes sold just 1,450 G-Class G580 off-roaders in Europe through to April of this year, German newspaper Handelsblatt recently revealed , noting that this was considerably below the cheaper combustion variants, which totaled 9,700 sales. The G-Class—formerly the G-Wagen, or Geländewagen, German for “cross-country vehicle” and originally developed for the German army—is a 45-year-old design, massively updated in 2022, but still ruggedly boxy when most EVs are aero and svelte. However, thanks to potential tariffs of up to 50 percent on imported cars from Europe, Mercedes likely won’t be able to rely on the US to make up for its poor European sales for the electrified G-Wagen. Handelsblatt cited an unnamed company insider saying the G580 has been a “complete flop” since its launch in April last year. This is not the official line. “Mercedes-Benz is prepared for all market scenarios,” says an email from company PR officer Markus Nast. “Into the 2030s, we can flexibly offer vehicles with both a fully electric drivetrain or an electrified high-tech combustion engine. Our customers decide what suits them best.” But it seems those customers are mostly choosing cheaper ICE versions rather than the e-makeovers. Why settle for the faux G-Roar —a soundbar-actuated facsimile of a V8 engine piped into and around the electric G-Wagen—when you can have the genuine grumble, and at less cost? The extra $14,000 is an awful lot to pay for an all-terrain EV that on the outside appears almost the same as the $148,000 gas variant. The ICE version of the G-Wagen might not have a button-activated 720-degree on-the-spot spin —a road-chewing donuting feature first introduced by Rivian yet soon dropped—but the gas guzzler has a 500-mile range while the G580 can only manage 239 miles, a likely deal breaker for those who want to travel long distances for their off-asphalt adventures (even though electric powertrains have much to offer 4x4 action, with instant torque, better traction, less maintenance and a lower center of gravity.) Porsche has cut back its plans for EVs amid soft sales of the electric Macan SUV and Taycan. Photograph: Porsche Of course, this is likely not a whole heap of customers. Most G-Wagens—ICE and electric—live in the city, owned as military-chic status symbols. Those truly into the niche world of long-range backcountry EVs can save $60,000 by shunning the 570-horsepower G580 with almost no towing capacity for a $105,000, 850-hp Rivian R1S with a 410-mile range and plenty of oomph left over for pulling stuff. “Premium EVs [from legacy automakers] are not quite as amazing as they should be,” says Wells, and their introduction—in what could be characterized as the Cybertruck crunch—has often come at the cost of “neglecting the development of smaller EVs with mass appeal.” On this front, legacy automakers are losing out to China , at least in those countries where Chinese EVs are sold. Which is most places except the US. According to a new report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), global EV sales will surpass 20 million in 2025, accounting for more than a quarter of cars sold worldwide. In the first three months of 2025, electric car sales worldwide were up 35 percent over the previous year. And, adds the IEA, market share is on course to exceed 40 percent by 2030 as EVs—smaller, cheaper ones, mainly—become increasingly affordable in more markets. Almost half of all car sales in China last year were electric. Emerging markets in Asia and Latin America have also become new centers of growth, with total EV sales across these regions surging by more than 60 percent in 2024, according to the IEA. Meanwhile, EV sales grew by about 10 percent year-on-year in the US. “Our data shows that, despite significant uncertainties, electric cars remain on a strong growth trajectory globally,” says IEA executive director Fatih Birol. “Sales continue to set new records, with major implications for the international auto industry. This year, we expect more than one in four cars sold worldwide to be electric, with growth accelerating in many emerging economies. By the end of this decade, it is set to be more than two in five.” China, which accounts for more than 70 percent of global EV production , shipped nearly 1.25 million electric cars to other countries last year. The ending of EV subsidies in the EU has impacted European sales. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU’s EV market share in 2024 fell to 13.6 percent, down 1 percent from the prior year. Volkswagen’s luxury marques, including Porsche, Bentley, and Lamborghini, are reassessing their EV strategies. Porsche has scaled back plans for an all-electric lineup following a 49 percent decline in Taycan sales . Bentley has pushed back the launch of its first EV from this year to next, and extended its gas-engine phase-out deadline to 2035. Lamborghini has delayed its Lanzador EV until 2029 at the earliest . Wait a few months and you might well be able to pick up a G580 for considerably less than its $162,000 list price. You can currently bag a three-year-old Porsche Taycan, with its 416 miles of range, for less than half what it cost new. Currently, there are 930 used Taycans for sale in the US on Auto Trader , with prices ranging from just $44,000 when a base model costs at least $100,000 new. A Taycan with just 11,000 miles on the clock can be had for $47,000. US and European car makers—legacy and startups—may wish there was high demand for premium-priced prestige EVs ( Jaguar is staking its future business on this ), but for some years now the market has been crying out, instead, for cheaper, entry-level models. The favored method by the modern auto industry of filling flagships with their best wares then letting these slowly trickle down to lower-tier cars is not realistic right now, says Dale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at London’s Royal College of Art. “The same tech is basically in all electric vehicles,” says Harrow. “So, for the first time, there's no real guarantee that spending a lot more money is going to buy a better product. Look at the vehicles coming in from BYD.” Instead, Harrow feels automakers must wean themselves off flagship-first dependancy, ape Ford's classic Model T strategy, and concentrate on building EVs accessible to the masses through a combination of affordability, simplicity, and mass production. And guess who has already worked this out? Yep, China —where nearly 40 percent of all electric models are priced under $25,000. It is this strategy, rather than gimmicky tank-turns, that will drive real adoption and encourage the spread of viable charging networks. After all, it was the ubiquity of the Model T that played a pivotal role in the development of gas stations —and there's absolutely no reason why that same trick can't be turned for the electric age.

Electric vehicles have significant environmental advantages over similar gas-powered vehicles, but the percentage of Americans who believe so has gone down slightly over the last two years. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images Everyone knows that electric vehicles are supposed to be better for the planet than gas cars. That's the driving reason behind a global effort to transition toward batteries. But what about the harms caused by mining for battery minerals ? And coal-fired power plants for the electricity to charge the cars? And battery waste ? Is it really true that EVs are better? The answer is yes. But Americans are growing less convinced. The net benefits of EVs have been frequently fact-checked, including by NPR . ""No technology is perfect, but the electric vehicles are going to offer a significant benefit as compared to the internal combustion engine vehicles,"" Jessika Trancik, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NPR this spring . Sponsor Message Up First from NPR The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles It's important to ask these questions about EVs' hidden costs, Trancik says. But they have been answered ""exhaustively"" — her word — and a wide range of organizations have confirmed that EVs still beat gas . But the share of car-buying Americans who believe that has gone down by 5 percentage points in the last two years, from 63% to 58%, according to data that the market research firm Ipsos shared exclusively with NPR. Loading... The decrease is small, but statistically significant. It's also not evenly distributed. People who say they are interested in buying an EV, known in the auto industry as ""EV considerers,"" remain solidly convinced that EVs have an environmental benefit. (And it's important to note that the size of this pool — people considering EVs — has been holding pretty steady over this time frame.) It's people who are not open to getting an EV who are increasingly skeptical of those vehicles' green credentials. ""The true story to me is that rise of skepticism among the non-considerers specifically,"" Ipsos researcher Graham Gordon says. ""They are becoming more and more unified in their idea that it is not better for the environment."" Complexity, confusion and the culture wars Where is this skepticism coming from? Partly, it could be a misinterpretation of accurate reporting. Electric vehicles have no tailpipe emissions, which is why they are called ""zero-emission vehicles."" But they are not entirely zero-emission: Pollution and other environmental costs are associated with building them and charging their batteries. Sponsor Message Journalists have done a lot of work explaining those environmental harms, and the public has noticed. That's good news: Trancik, of MIT, says people should ask questions about the true environmental costs of all technology. But the mountain of research determining that EVs are still cleaner than gasoline-powered cars doesn't seem to have gotten as much traction. The complexity itself can be frustrating. EV fans and skeptics alike say it's difficult to figure out for themselves how the harms compare. ""I don't have the expertise to evaluate this,"" one non-EV driver told NPR. ""It's hard to really know,"" another said. Meanwhile, EVs have gotten caught up in the culture wars , where complexity and nuance go to die. EVs are associated with coastal, urban progressive elites. Plans to phase out gas cars in California and other regions have sparked fierce and sometimes misleading resistance from the fossil fuel industry. National Biden faces criticism over his gas car ban. But he doesn't have one Memes that exaggerate or distort the real harms of EVs — or that simply fail to compare them with the damage caused by gas cars — frequently circulate online . A case study in distortion: tire emissions This spring, a game of telephone took place. The Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed criticizing California's EV mandate that included a statistic from a company called Emissions Analytics. That caused other outlets to discover Emissions Analytics' work, including the New York Post, which ran this headline : ""Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions, are worse for the environment than gas-powered cars: study."" That headline, in turn, spread far and wide. ""I just saw this thing that said that the environmental impact of electric cars is actually worse overall than the environmental impact of a traditional combustion engine,"" Joe Rogan said on his popular podcast. ""Is that true? Because that sounds crazy."" What was lost, in this game of telephone, was the narrow focus of the original data. Sponsor Message The researcher behind the original study, Nick Molden, explains that he looked at tire and brake emissions — particulate matter, tiny particles that wear off tires and brake pads — and did not consider other emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, at all. Put differently: The idea that his work shows EVs are worse for the environment would make sense only if you ignore the existence of climate change. Molden says the climate benefits of EVs are important. His work is about a specific trade-off. ""Those people misusing it don't bring out that tension,"" he says. ""They conflate and blur and obfuscate and play fast and loose with the definitions. And that's completely wrong."" Tire and brake emissions are a real problem. (And a complicated one: EVs are heavy, which is bad for these emissions, but regenerative braking could counter that effect, Molden says.) Business The race is on to build EV battery-recycling plants in the U.S. There's a similar nugget of truth behind lots of the arguments that EVs aren't green. Lots of electricity does come from fossil fuels. Batteries do require mining and, eventually, recycling. Analysts say these are good arguments for smaller cars, cleaner grids, better mining , more recycling, more transit and walkable cities. They may support a case for plug-in hybrid vehicles; it depends how people use them. But they're not an environmental case for traditional gas cars. EVs still beat gas. Will these distortions hold back EV adoption? EV sales growth in the U.S. has slowed — in fact, the automotive data giant J.D. Power predicts that EVs as a share of new-car sales just peaked for the year at 9.2%. That's well below the rate in Europe and China, and it falls short of what most analysts and automakers had expected. Could doubts and distortions about EVs' environmental impact play a role in that? Maybe. J.D. Power's data also shows that helping the environment is one of the top three reasons that people go electric today, at least for mass-market buyers. Business Their batteries hurt the environment, but EVs still beat gas cars. Here's why On the other hand, Ipsos' data suggests that the people losing faith in EVs' green credentials weren't likely to consider buying EVs anyway. There's other data to suggest a potentially muted impact on sales: According to Gallup researcher Jeff Jones, who ran a new analysis on 2023 data for NPR, the Americans who are most skeptical about EVs' environmental benefits also tend to be the people who worry the least about the climate. Meanwhile, issues aside from the environment — namely cost and convenience — are key to winning over any would-be EV buyer. Sponsor Message Elizabeth Krear of J.D. Power has been closely tracking why people who are thinking of buying an EV choose not to take the plunge. This pool includes plenty of people who are fully convinced of EVs' green virtues. ""Those top reasons for rejection consistently, month over month, all have to do with charging,"" she says. ""Having the ability to charge in public, having enough stations readily available and visible, speed of charging."" And over time, these non-environmental factors will get only more important, many analysts say. ""That first wave of [EV] ownership, they did believe in those environmental benefits, and that was one thing that pushed them towards ownership,"" says Gordon, of Ipsos. ""This next wave … that's not what's going to push them to ownership. Instead, what's pushing them into ownership is going to be longer ranges, faster charging times, lower costs, better charging infrastructure."" All those things remain hurdles for many drivers, including Austin Kampen, who lives in Missouri. He thinks EVs probably are better for the planet. His mom is convinced they have no benefits — they've talked about it (he even played her an NPR podcast about it). But does that change whether either of them is likely to buy an EV? Well, no. ""It wouldn't really matter to us if it was green or not,"" Kampen says, ""because it seems kind of out of reach for us."" And making EVs feel within reach is going to be key to winning over all car shoppers — whatever they believe about the environment. electric vehicles EVs gasoline climate change pollution Automotive Industry Cars misinformation Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Transcripts Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor Message Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",,Y,

Choosing the right used BMW 3 Series for you The BMW 3 Series was introduced in 1975, so you can find a wide range of used BMW 3 Series for re-sale.

BMW history and evolution From planes to motorcycles, kitchen utensils to race cars, BMW has produced many things over its 100 plus years in business. Originally established as an aircraft manufacturer, BMW released their first motorcycle, the R32, in 1923, and their first car, the Dixi 3/15, in 1928. Post-WWII, the company struggled to find their footing. The 1952 BMW 501 sedan helped the company regain its reputation for making exciting luxury vehicles. The 1961 BMW 1500, the first of the New Class line, turned BMW back into a profitable carmaker. The 1970s saw the launch of the BMW 3-Series, 5-Series and 7-Series, the success of which continues today. The BMW i3, the first all-electric BMW, launched in 2013, paving the way towards the company's growing selection of hybrid and electric models today.

These are all pretty nice cars, so my wish list basically comes down to price and range. Must have an estimated range of approx 300 miles or more. On price, I think the Cadillacs and Genesis have an edge, depending on what's on the lot. Here is my short list. Genesis GV60 Audi Q6 eTron Cadillac Lyric Cadillac Optiq Acura ZDX ETA: I expect to own the car for its entire life, so it does not pencil out cheaper to lease.

Choosing the right used BMW 3 Series for you The BMW 3 Series was introduced in 1975, so you can find a wide range of used BMW 3 Series for re-sale. Over seven generations, BMW has produced BMW 3 Series sedans , convertibles , coupes and wagons . While the current generation (2018 onwards) offers the most up-to-date tech and safety features, earlier generations have a larger variety of body styles. Try narrowing your search by filtering for used BMW 3 Series cars with gas, diesel or hybrid powertrains; automatic or manual transmission; or rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. One thing to keep in mind is that for 2022, the BMW 3 Series is only available as a four-door sedan. Advantages of buying a used BMW 3 Series When shopping for a luxury car like a BMW 3 Series, buying secondhand has big benefits. A used BMW 3 Series can be significantly more affordable than a new model, letting you afford a nicer trim level or upgraded features on a smaller budget.

We recommend that you pass on any vehicle receiving a rating between 0 and 1. 2.0: Cars landing in this set are also rare. Only true love and limitless passion (or a free vehicle) should allow you to give in to temptation for one of these vehicles. 3.0: Is the vehicle you’re looking at in this range? We’d bet that if you look a little harder, you’ll find a better vehicle at a similar price to fulfill your needs. 4.0: This is the area where the rubber meets the recommendations. The 3-4 range is full of good cars and some great ones. Starting here, it’s OK to listen to your heart. 5.0: These scores represent the cream of the crop, with “5.0” representing, well, near perfection. Any car you choose in this group will treat you very well over time. How Kelley Blue Book Rates Cars Rather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, KBB’s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class.
    Before any car earns its KBB rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it’s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing. Our editors drive and live with a given vehicle.
    We ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price.
    Does it serve the purpose for which it was built? (Whether that purpose is commuting efficiently to and from work in the city, keeping your family safe, making you feel like you’ve made it to the top — or that you’re on your way — or making you feel like you’ve finally found just the right partner for your lifestyle.) We take each vehicle we test through the mundane — parking, lane-changing, backing up, cargo space and loading — as well as the essential — acceleration, braking, handling, interior quiet and comfort, build quality, materials quality, reliability.

See All the Latest Electric News FAQ How can I improve the mileage of an electric car? Minimize acceleration – electric cars’ quick acceleration is fun, but do not use it all the time. Watch your speed – fuel economy on any vehicle is impacted by how fast you drive. Stay under 60 when you can. Don’t forget the regenerative breaking setting – when coming to a stop, utilize the electric car’s energy-recovering regenerative braking and minimize using regular breaking. When coming to a stop, leave enough room for the car to slow before breaking. Check your tire pressure – if your tires are not properly inflated, it will lead to increased energy consumption. Condition the battery – battery health is critical for longevity of a vehicle. Talk with the car dealer on the best ways to keep your model’s battery in prime condition. Plan car charging times – you do not want to charge your car all the time; you want to plan to charge just before you are set to leave because the battery will start discharging when the battery is full. Use the heater less – the heater will drain your battery. Some EVs have heated seats and other warming features that do not put as much drain on the battery; if it is safe to do so, use those features to stay warm. Cut down on the A/C – it is easy to say to cut down on the A/C, and in some climates, it is not possible, but the compressor in the A/C can drain your battery. Plan a fuel-efficient route – heavy traffic areas should be avoided. Try to choose a route will allow you a smoother ride with less stop and gos. What is the future of electric cars? All manufacturers are heavily investing in electric cars and many, like GMC, have announced that within the next 5-15 years, their goal is to only sell electric cars. While there are currently a lot of electric cars, even more are coming in 2022 and 2023. With each vehicle iteration, electric cars are adding more features and extending their range. Electric cars are here to stay. Some of the most popular electric vehicles are the Tesla Cybertruck, the 2022 Ford Lightning, the Rivian R1T, 2022 Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron, and the 2022 EV Hummer Truck and the SUV in 2023. What are the types of electric cars? EV – Electric Vehicle EV stands for electric vehicle. EVs Fully their power from motors that use batteries charged with electricity. PHEV – Plug-in Hybrid PHEV stands for plug-in hybrid. PHEVs charge via an outlet to charge its batteries which allows the car to drive a set number of miles as an electric car. It also uses gas or alternative fuel to power the internal combustion engine. The car will use gas when the electric battery is fully discharged. The combination of electric and gas gives the vehicle great fuel economy. HEV – Hybrid Electric Vehicle Hybrid electric vehicles use an electric motor that uses energy from a battery and internal combustion engine. Regenerative braking is used to charge the battery by storing energy created when slowing the car. BEV – Battery-Powered Electric Vehicle A BEV, or battery-powered electric vehicle, uses only its electric motor or motors for propulsion. FCEV – Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles A Fuel cell electric vehicle runs on compressed hydrogen, but these vehicles are not widely available except in California. Can I get an electric car in any model?

Since then, it has evolved through seven generations of sedans, coupes, convertibles and hatchbacks. While the first generation would be considered boxy by modern tastes, their performance was seen as unmatched at the time. Today's models are sleek and full of dynamic features while still maintaining that original mix of speed, power and German engineering that made the BMW 3 Series a success. Whether you're looking for a classic like the BMW 325i cabriolet or something a bit more modern like the BMW 330i xDrive, you can find used BMW 3 Series cars for sale in Westmount on Kijiji Autos. BMW 3 Series features As with any long-running car series, available features will vary widely between used BMW 3 Series cars from different eras. When looking at older BMW 3 Series vehicles, you are likely to find attractive cars with premium leather interiors that are fun to drive thanks to powerful engines. However, interior features are unlikely to match what's available now. If we look at something from 2020, the BMW 330i sport sedan has a powerful 255 horsepower four-cylinder engine, while the all-wheel-drive M330i xDrive can do 0-60 mph in a speedy 5.2 seconds. Inside the 2020 vehicles, you can expect perks like heated seats and steering wheel, advanced safety features like lane-keeping assist and an updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay.

Reviews Cars For Sale Consumer Reviews Styles Specs & Features Safety Compare 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 Review By Colin Ryan Updated May 21, 2025 Colin Ryan specializes in writing about new cars. He has done this for the Los Angeles Times, Variety, Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader, Popular Mechanics, Mazda and Lexus customer magazines, plus a bunch of enthusiast sites and publications. And he spent several years as a staff writer at BBC Top Gear magazine. During this zig-zag of a career trajectory, he has driven everything from budget Malaysian hatchbacks (yes, they exist) to scarily expensive Italian exotica. Pros Multiple Kelley Blue Book award-winner Fast charging Great range Cons No hands-free driving What's New? More range Rugged XRT trim High-performance Ioniq 5 N The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a high point in electric vehicles because it excels in several areas. Pricing starts at $44,100. The Ioniq 5 has won our Best Buy Award in the electric vehicle (EV) class two years in a row. From its design to its practicality, from its effective powertrains to how easy it is to live with on a day-to-day basis, this is exactly how an EV should be. Two of the most crucial areas with an EV are how much distance it can cover and how quickly it can charge. Hyundai has endowed the Ioniq 5 with the ability to impress in both respects. Overall, we’ve enjoyed ourselves so much whenever we’ve been in an Ioniq 5 that time has indeed flown. This is now the third year of its existence, during a period in automotive history where change is happening almost daily. Yet the Ioniq 5 has the goods to keep its lofty position, an assertion backed by the vast majority of our owner reviews. We’ve logged hundreds of hours driving and researching this generation of electric SUVs , including the Hyundai Ioniq 5. What's New for 2025 The Ioniq 5 offers two battery capacities, both expand for 2025. This will have a positive effect on range by as much as 20 miles on rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) models.  This is the first year for the XRT grade, which adds a bit of off-road credibility with 18-inch wheels, increased ride height, a surround view camera, a few exterior upgrades, and more. The high-performance Ioniq 5 N also arrives this year, blending electric propulsion with enthusiast appeal. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 Pricing The 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 has a starting sticker price of $44,100, with the range-topping IONIQ 5 XRT w/Tow Hitch kicking off at $57,450. MSRP KBB Fair Purchase Price (national avg.) SE Standard Range $44,100 $42,644 SE $48,150 $47,572 SEL $51,100 $50,205 Limited $55,800 $54,806 XRT $57,000 $56,772 XRT w/Tow Hitch $57,450 TBD The SE price we list is for rear-wheel drive with standard range. To bump up the SE range by enlarging the battery will set you back about $4,000. SEL versions tend to be the better sellers, with pretty much an even split between rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. No matter the trim level, except the standard all-wheel-drive XRT, factor in about $3,500 for all-wheel drive, which also brings the bigger battery and a second electric motor. The Ioniq 5 is in the same financial ballpark as rivals such as the Kia EV6 , Ford Mustang Mach-E , Volkswagen ID.4 , Tesla Model Y , Toyota bZ4X , and Nissan Ariya . Before buying a new Ioniq 5 electric vehicle, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should be paying. Resale values are about typical for the class. Recouping more money when you sell a vehicle can mean a bigger down payment and lower monthly payments on your next one. Power, Ride and Handling The popular Ioniq 5 SEL with all-wheel drive features a muscular 320 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. Hyundai might even boost output this year. In which case, it could sprint from standstill to 60 mph quicker than 2024’s extremely rapid 4.5 seconds. An equivalent Ford Mustang Mach-E has similar power and speed. We really like driving the Ioniq 5. One aspect is that it’s easy to just get in, select Drive and go. The learning curve is far from steep. Another aspect is that the Ioniq 5 can be many things to many drivers. Around town and on the freeway, it’s comfortable and quiet, maneuverable and responsive. Ask it to corner faster and brake harder, though, and it still delivers. With brake energy regeneration set to its highest level, the Ioniq 5 can come to a complete stop just by keeping the right foot off the accelerator. This is one-pedal driving, a neat trick exclusive to electric vehicles, and not so tiring in city traffic compared with the usual frantic dance between the accelerator and brakes. The new-for-2025 Ioniq 5 N comes with a phenomenal 601 horsepower, or 641 horses in boost mode. That will send it flashing to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds. It also has a bespoke chassis made for enthusiastic driving, plus sport fronts seats, upgraded brakes, and extra body stiffening. Tech-Rich Interior Something as contemporary as an Ioniq 5 electric vehicle should surely come with wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration. But up until now, it’s been cable connection all the way. Let’s see if Hyundai takes it to the next level this year. However, if the main gripe about this car can be remedied by a $5 cord with a USB-A plug at one end, then the company has still done an amazing job. The tech is impressive, as demonstrated by the 12.3-inch driver information display and 12.3-inch infotainment system touchscreen combined into one sleek unit. The SEL adds wireless device charging and ambient cabin lighting, while the Limited trim comes with a head-up display enhanced by augmented reality (AR). The top Limited version also has a huge single-pane glass roof, bringing extra airiness to a cabin that’s already spacious for what is essentially a compact SUV. The rear seats split, fold, slide and recline. Maximum rear legroom is 39.4 inches, more than a Toyota RAV4. And it’s a flat floor throughout. Cargo space goes from 26.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats to 58.5 cubic feet when they’re folded, making the Ioniq 5 one of the most practical in its class. There’s also a storage area of just under one cubic foot up front, beneath the hood. It’s somewhere to throw smelly gym clothes and/or a charge cable — but not much else. Sharp Exterior At this point, we’ve probably all seen an Ioniq 5 in the wild and formed our own opinions. We appreciate how the clean, sharp lines of the body are contrasted with ornately mathematical alloy wheel designs. Aerodynamic considerations also contributed to the clamshell hood and flush-fitting door handles. The raised ride height nudges this vehicle into the SUV category — its ground clearance will help a bit when driving through snow. Our Favorite Features and Tech Ultra-fast charging The Ioniq 5’s batteries can cope with an 800-volt DC fast charger. On a 350-kilowatt unit, all it takes is 18 minutes to go from 10% to 80% capacity, making the Ioniq 5 one the fastest-charging EVs out there. It’s still a relatively quick 25 minutes on a 400-volt, 150-kilowatt charger. Digital Key Standard in the SEL, this allows users with an Android-based phone to access the Ioniq 5. It’s easy to set up and authorize other people. Apple iPhone owners have been able to use a key card in the past, but Hyundai may update that technology this year. Hands-free tailgate operation with auto-open Detecting the key’s proximity, the powered tailgate opens automatically, so there’s no need to wave a foot under the bumper. This comes in at the SEL trim level. Driver’s seat leg support In the short-ish time it takes to recharge an Ioniq 5 EV, drivers can relax by reclining their power-adjustable seat and extending the leg support — like an airplane seat in business class. This is exclusive to the Limited trim, though. Reverse charging The correct jargon is vehicle-to-load, or V2L. It means that electricity can also be taken out of the battery (as long as it has more than 20% juice) to power an air fryer while camping or keep the fridge running during a power outage, for instance. It’s another standard feature in the Limited model. Remote Smart Parking Assist The Limited trim gets all the really cool stuff. Like this feature allowing drivers to inch their Ioniq 5 into or out of a parking space using remote control, while standing outside the vehicle. Range and Charging The standard-range SE version of the 2025 Ioniq 5 with rear-wheel drive sees a modest boost in battery size and an increase in range to 245 miles. SEL and Limited models receive a bigger battery, too, which will push their range to 318 miles. All-wheel-drive versions of the Ioniq 5 can travel up to 290 miles on a charge. These improvements make the Ioniq 5 quite competitive within its class. It’s also competitive in terms of charging, taking as few as 18 minutes to go from 10% to 80% capacity using a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger. That’s comparable to a Tesla, and puts the Ioniq 5 comfortably above many other rivals. Speaking of Tesla, the Ioniq 5 now has access to the more than 17,000 Tesla Superchargers across the country. 5-Year/60,000-Mile Warranty Hyundai has some of the longest warranties in the business. The company’s new-vehicle coverage lasts five years or 60,000 miles, whichever happens first. Powertrains and the Ioniq 5’s battery have warranties of 10 years or 100,000 miles. Hyundai also includes three years of free scheduled servicing. Safety Ratings The Ioniq 5 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ). Standard safety equipment includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian/cyclist detection, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, and Safe Exit Assist.

Option 2: Open the ChargeUp app and type in the charging station ID listed on the label. Option 3: Hold the RFID card against the reader to activate the charging process. Step 2: Charge, Wait & Monitor Plug the connector, with an adapter if needed, into your vehicle’s charging port. You can wait at the Recharge Hub while your EV charges or visit nearby downtown businesses. Please keep an eye on your charging status so you can end the session once your charge is complete. An idle fee of $1.00 per minute is applied after a 10-minute grace period if the vehicle is fully charged and the session has not ended. When finished, please remove the connector from the port and return the cable to the station. Recharge Hub and ChargeUp App FAQs Why is my charging session not working? Be sure to check the following: The charger is on and operating You are connected to the ChargeUp app You have funds in your account You are using the appropriate cable for your vehicle The cable is fully plugged into the charging port If issues persist, please contact OUC at (407) 434-2890 . For issues relating to the charger interface or app please contact ChargeUp at (833) 789-1400 . This information can also be found on the ChargeUp app. What is an idle fee? Am I paying the fee to park while I am charging? An idle fee is a $1.00 per minute fee that occurs when a vehicle has fully charged but has remained connected to the charger for more than 10 minutes. The idle fee is not billed while your vehicle is actively charging. Please monitor your charging session either at the charger or through the ChargeUp app so you can disconnect and allow other customers to use the charging location once your vehicle has been fully charged. Why am I not getting the advertised charging speeds? A DC fast charger can typically charge an EV to 80% in about 30 minutes. Charging from 80% to 100% typically takes about the same time as it does to charge to 80%. Charging speeds may vary for a few reasons: Temperature: Some EVs may have internal battery management systems to protect the battery from overheating, so the charging rate may be reduced to protect the health of the battery. Charging can also become less efficient in extreme temperatures because energy is being used to heat or cool the battery as needed. The charge of your vehicle: An EV’s charge rate starts fast and reduces as the battery fills. This is to protect your battery from overheating. So, if your EV is able to accept 120kW, it may get that speed at the beginning depending on the state of charge, and then will quickly reduce until the battery is full. The charging speed capabilities of your vehicle: Different vehicles have different maximum charging speeds. For example, one vehicle may have a maximum charge rate of 55kW while another may have a maximum charge rate of 350kW. The vehicle with the 55kW maximum will not be able to accept the full 120kW or 240kW as advertised. Power sharing: Our stations use power sharing, so chargers that are connected to the same power source will split the power. For example, if two cars are plugged into the same dual-port, 240kW station each plug will have a maximum charge of 120kW. As a best practice, leave one parking space between you and another vehicle. What are the best practices for connecting the charger with my car? OUC electric vehicle charging hubs feature Direct Current (DC) fast charging stations, which can only provide charge for vehicles that are all-battery electric. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are not compatible with DC fast charge. DC fast charging can be done using different connector types. Our hub connectors include CCS-1, 1 CHAdeMO, and NACS (Tesla). Be sure you pick the appropriate connector for your vehicle. Am I able to use these chargers if I own a Tesla? Yes, our stations use the CCS connector, but there are additional steps you should follow: 1. Ensure that your vehicle is CCS adapter enabled. Verify this by going to your vehicle’s settings. If your vehicle is not CCS adapter enabled, you will not be able to use the CCS connectors without a retrofit, which is sold by Tesla. Look under software ➔ additional vehicle information ➔ CCS adapter support: Enabled or Not Installed 2. If your vehicle is CCS adapter enabled, you will need to charge using a CCS Combo 1 adapter, which is different from the J1772 adapter that comes with a Tesla purchase (the J1772 adapter is for Level 2 charging). OUC’s ReCharge Mobility Hubs include CCS adapters for use by customers, but you may also bring your own to use. When using a CCS adapter, for ease of use, we recommend connecting the adapter to the CCS port first and then plugging it into your vehicle. Has my car been towed? Parking is only for EVs in a charging session. There is a four-hour charging limit at OUC Recharge Hubs. Vehicles that have charging sessions over four hours are subject to be towed at the owner’s expense. If you believe your vehicle has been towed, contact Johnson’s Wrecker Service at (407) 293-2540 or (800) 940-8693 .

Learn more about purchasing used electric cars from our nonprofit's free Used Electric Cars Guide . What is the Best EV Range for You? This depends on you. The average American drives 37 miles per day . Most charging can be done at home or while you’re at work. Think first and foremost about your daily commute and secondarily how often you travel long distances. According to a recent Bloomberg survey , two thirds of respondents indicated that 300-plus miles of range was enough for their needs. For the times you take a road trip, you will want to plan your roadside charging along the way. Generally, high speed charging is available on main corridors across the country, usually near restaurants or shopping. This will get you an 80% charge in about 30 minutes. Consider also how long you need to drive in cold weather. Much like the loss of energy efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles, EV battery range can drop significantly in cold weather . However, a 2025 report found that electric vehicles remain fully functional in extreme cold, with even the worst-performing models still retaining over 60% of their range and quickly regaining power with a short charge. The best performing models only lost 14% of their range. Keep in mind you’ll have more range with stop and go driving than out on the open highway, due to the fact that the act of braking regenerates the battery. On the highway, it’s possible to increase your range significantly – even above the EPA rated range – by slowing your speed to around 60 mph. You’ll get very familiar with your EV’s range once you test it out at different speeds and under different terrains and weather conditions. EV Charging and Range FAQs How Far Can I Drive Before I Need To Charge the Battery? How far an EV can go before it needs to be charged depends on an electric vehicle’s make and model, the current amount of charge and driving conditions. Read our tips below for getting more range out of an EV’s battery. How Can I Find EV Charging Stations? Most EV drivers charge at home overnight if/when needed, waking up to a fully charged EV. If you live in an apartment or don’t have off-street parking, you may be able to charge for free at your workplace or other free public chargers. If you do plan to take longer trips, just a little planning will ensure you can find charging stations along the way. Fast charging “level 3” stations (usually located near markets and restaurants) already enable charging up to 80% full in about 30 minutes, making EV road trips with fueling stops/meal breaks easy. Battery technology is quickly improving too – faster ways to charge your EV are currently being developed. Also, keep in mind that there are many free places to charge your EV , as well as ways you can keep your EV going during power shutoffs . How Can I Charge My EV at Home? EVs can charge anywhere there is a normal 120v outlet – no more going to the gas station. EVs come with a plug that will work in a regular electric outlet, and add about 40 miles of range overnight. However, you also might want to consider a level 2 EV charger at your home – this is typically a 240v outlet like the one many people have for their electric clothes dryer. This charger gives about 25 to 40 miles of range per hour. Many EV drivers use a home level 2 charger to top up to a full charge overnight. About 1/3 of electric car drivers have rooftop solar, so their electricity is coming from sunshine – saving fuel costs as well as the environment.

"Just How Dirty is Your EV? Shoppers Owners Dealers Sign In Shoppers Owners Dealers Sign In Research Carbon Footprint Face-Off: A Full Picture of EVs vs. Gas Cars Technical Input By Written by River James January 20, 2025 Sell Your EV to Experts Share Research Carbon Footprint Face-Off: A Full Picture of EVs vs. Gas Cars For many, sweating through the hottest summer on record , complete with apocalyptic orange skies and unbreathable air , turned environmentally sustainable choices into an urgent priority. When it comes to making an environmentally conscious choice for your next vehicle, people are betting electric is the way to go. But are EVs really as green as they claim? A quiet, zippy electric car sure seems easier on the atmosphere than a gigantic gas guzzler. But what are the hidden environmental costs of production? How did that car get on the road in the first place? EV’s dirty secret Manufacturing takes an incredible toll on the environment and releases tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year. Making cars is no exception. In fact, when you look at carbon emissions alone, manufacturing an EV is actually worse for the planet than making a conventional car. This comes down to the effects of mining, transporting, and refining battery materials. But EVs do “break even” with gas powered cars over time. How long does it take to reach the break even point? Does it matter where you live and how you power your car? How much does electricity generation matter? EV lifecycle emissions When people think about car emissions, most think about tailpipe emissions - aka the smog that comes from the back of your car as you drive. This is what we normally think about when it comes to car emissions However, climate scientists look at the bigger picture when it comes to emissions. That means in addition to operational emissions, scientists have to consider the total lifecycle emissions associated with producing and distributing cars and their fuels. Lifecycle emission assessments may also be called “cradle-to-grave” since they start with the “birth” of the car and end with its “death.” This sort of calculation adds up all the ways that emissions can be associated with a car - manufacturing, operating, upstream emissions, and end of life. 1 - Manufacturing Emissions At the beginning of a car’s life cycle, there are the emissions from vehicle manufacturing. In addition to the carbon emissions from the manufacturing process, raw materials needed to make electric vehicle batteries , like cobalt and lithium, are acquired through difficult and hazardous mining operations, many linked to human rights violations. The massive amount of groundwater required for battery production also means making electric cars can use 50% more water than manufacturing traditional combustion vehicles. As an example, manufacturing an average gas powered sedan creates about six metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, but manufacturing an electric vehicle of the same size creates more than 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. As EVs become more popular, the problem is getting more attention, and even EV automakers are calling to decarbonize supply chains. So, electric cars start “in debt” when it comes to their carbon emissions - either 10 metric tons in total, or 1.3 to 2 times more greenhouse gasses than ICE vehicles, depending how you’re accounting. Gas car - 6 to 9 metric tons CO2 EV - 11 to 14 metric tons CO2 Can EVs really be the better choice once they are on the road? Operational Emissions Operational emissions are the thing most people think of when they think about auto emissions - the stuff coming out of your tailpipe. It’s a big phrase for a simple concept. It’s also where EVs rapidly catch up with gas cars in the race to clean transport. When it comes to carbon accounting, the very best thing about electric cars is that they produce zero tailpipe emissions when they are used. No smog, no NOx, nothing to make the air around them difficult or dangerous to breathe. On the other hand, gas cars produce a lot of tailpipe emissions - more than 50% of their lifetime emissions come from day to day use. For a single mile, gas cars produce about 400 grams of CO2, and 8,887 grams CO2 per gallon burned. Over their entire lifetime, assuming 11,000 miles a year and a 12 year life, that’s 46 metric tons of CO2. Gas car - 6 + 57 metric tons CO2 = 63 metric tons CO2 EV - 11 metric tons CO2 2 - Upstream Emissions Although operational emissions seem simple, there is more than meets the eye. Regardless of how your car is powered, you need to get the fuel, and there are carbon emissions associated with getting and transporting that fuel. For gas cars, this means the emissions that come from drilling for, refining, and transporting gas. For EVs, there are emissions associated with generating electricity from natural gas, coal, or, preferably, renewable sources. As EV skeptics love to point out, non-renewable fuel still accounts for 78.5% of electricity production nationally , so producing electricity is not yet that clean. Globally, it is still twice as “dirty” as refining gasoline, even though there are a lot of regional variations. Countries or states that have a lot of renewable energy produce “cleaner” electricity than those that rely heavily on natural gas or coal. As of 2023, a report from Polestar and Rivian put the upstream emissions of a gas car at around half that of an EV. For the life of a car, this report estimates 13 metric tons CO2 for a gas car, and 26 for an EV. Gas car - 6 + 57 + 13 metric tons CO2 = 76 metric tons CO2 EV - 11 + 26 metric tons CO2 = 37 metric tons CO2 Even though generating electricity can be dirty, it still generates less CO2 than the operational emissions of a gas car. Moreover, it’s important to consider EVs one step in the electrification future. Producing gasoline will never be renewable or carbon-free, and will probably never “cost” much less than 13 metric tons CO2. But, the electric grid can and will get cleaner. As the world relies more and more on clean energy, upstream emissions for electric vehicles will be reduced . When you power an EV with renewable energy, like solar or wind power, upstream emissions diminish. (To learn more about upstream emissions where you live, check out the EPA’s Beyond Tailpipe Emissions Calculator .) Lifecycle analysis from https://www.visualcapitalist.com/life-cycle-emissions-evs-vs-combustion-engine-vehicles/ 3 - End of life EVs are still fairly new technology. There is a lot of optimism around the reuse and recycling potential for their batteries, but most cars - and their batteries - are still on the road and in good shape. Other than that, electric cars are basically just very simple cars with fewer moving parts. Most carbon accounting, including the one illustrated above, assumes that EVs with have the same carbon impact as gas cars when it comes to end of life. Gas car - 6 + 57 + 13 metric tons CO2 = 76 metric tons CO2 EV - 11 + 26 metric tons CO2 = 37 metric tons CO2 ‍ So…how bad are EVs? To accurately compare the impact of gas cars and electric vehicles on the environment, we need to examine the complete lifecycle of the car - from manufacturing, to use, to when the cars get taken off the road. Gasoline powered vehicles start with manufacturing emissions, and then release 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide in tailpipe emissions for every gallon of fuel burned. Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, but do have associated upstream and manufacturing impact. So what does this look like over an average lifespan of a car? ‍ Over the course of its life, a new gasoline car will produce an average of 410 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new electric car will produce only 110 grams . Do electric cars ever catch up? Since EV manufacturing creates more emissions than ICE manufacturing, but their operational emissions are lower – how long does it take for an electric vehicle to “break even” with a gas powered car? When are electric cars really ""cleaner"" than gas cars? About 1.4 to 1.9 years. Around 2 years on the road, electric cars become cleaner than gas cars Yup, it takes less than 2 years for electric vehicles to catch up and start surpassing gas fueled cars when it comes to lifetime reduction in emissions. Fuel efficiency plays a significant role in this calculation. The average efficiency for gas cars in the U.S. is about 25 mpg . The average efficiency for an EV in the US is near 100 mpgE, or miles per gallon equivalent. It takes a lot less energy - around four times less - to go a mile in an EV. This is how an electric vehicle with average efficiency will be “cleaner” than the average gas car in less than 2 years, no matter where you live. Note that an extremely efficient gas vehicle, like the Mitsubishi Mirage, with a combined fuel efficiency of 39 mpg , can keep its lifetime carbon emissions below that of the average EV for 3-6 years, depending on the output emissions rate of your electric grid. However, the EV will eventually be cleaner, even if it takes a bit longer. The really interesting comparison is between fully battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Hybrids start out with less of a manufacturing emissions debt than BEVs, since they have smaller batteries. Being able to switch between fuel sources allows them to mitigate the emissions rates from both. Depending where you live and how long you plan to keep your car, a plug-in hybrid could be a greener choice than a fully electric vehicle. A PHEV on the cleanest electric grid generates the least amount of lifetime carbon emissions out of any vehicle type. Note: this calculation hinges on the PHEV being plugged in and used in EV mode whenever possible. ‍ Beyond Carbon Carbon pollution isn’t the only concern with regards to protecting the environment. A 2019 meta-analysis found that noise pollution from human activity should be considered a serious form of environmental change. Noise pollution hurts land and sea animals, and our health, as well. The World Health Organization strongly recommends reducing noise levels from road traffic to below 53 decibels during the day and 45 decibels at night. A busy street is about 75 to 85 decibels , loud enough that extended exposure can permanently damage hearing. Electric vehicles, on the other hand, are so quiet federal law requires EVs to generate artificial sounds when at low speeds to ensure pedestrian safety. Electric cars can be an important part of keeping our communities peaceful and quiet. EVs are also important for keeping the air in our local communities clean. Research shows more electric vehicles on the road improve air quality , regardless of how the electricity is generated. Many health conditions are worsened by ozone, particulate matter, and other pollutants, and the impacts of air pollution disproportionately affect minorities and disadvantaged communities. Choosing an EV means the air in your neighborhood, and your driveway, will be cleaner from day one. Recent research has complicated our understanding of vehicle pollution, however. The environmental benefits of electric vehicles are unevenly distributed across demographics. And while driving an EV makes the neighborhood around it cleaner, the neighborhood that generates electricity for that EV gets dirtier. One analysis found 91 percent of local pollution damages from driving an electric vehicle are exported to states other than the state in which the vehicle is driven . Their model was based on the electric grid as it was in 2010-2012, so it’s reasonable to assume the grid has improved considerably since. Even so, a national effort to transition to renewable energy sources is imperative to offset the emissions and environmental damage of electricity generation. Without major changes to the electricity sector, an increase in emissions from increased EV use could offset more than half the emission reductions from having fewer gas-powered vehicles on the road . The environmental impact of your vehicle is highly dependent upon where you live and how you get electricity or gasoline. The green cheat code The best way to reduce the environmental impact of a new car? Buy used! The battery and manufacturing processes are responsible for 35% of EV emissions . Buying a used EV reduces your carbon emissions to only the upstream emissions needed to power your vehicle. That’s about 1.3 metric tons annually, versus up to 5.8 metric tons for ICEVs. The next thing to clean up is electricity generation. With improving technology, we hope to rely on a greener national electric grid in the near future. Depending on where you live, this may be a reality already. But, many EV drivers are also able to install home solar and charge their cars, for free, using the sun. Gas car drivers will never have access to clean energy like that. The other critical step is battery recycling, which will reduce the carbon footprint of battery manufacturing - especially mining and refining critical minerals. Companies in the US and abroad are already working on this problem, and governments are finding ways to financially incentivize battery reuse and recycling. Hopefully, this effort will continue to pick up steam and reduce negative environmental impacts. Climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity. We need to act fast if we want a sustainable future. Fortunately, achieving net-zero emissions is possible - and adopting EVs is a critical step. We’ve already reached a tipping point for electric vehicle sales, paving the way for mass adoption. There is no way to completely eliminate carbon emissions from personal vehicle use, not even fully electric vehicles. But when it comes to protecting our planet, we don’t need to be perfect. We need to be better. The car you choose could make all the difference. ------------------------------ *Note on calculations: Assumptions for calculations above include an average EV efficiency of 0.35 kWh per mile and 8,887 gCO 2 e per gallon of gasoline burned.

Nissan Leaf cutaway showing part of the battery in 2009 An electric vehicle battery is a rechargeable battery used to power the electric motors of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). They are typically lithium-ion batteries that are designed for high power-to-weight ratio and energy density . Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower specific energy . This increases the weight of vehicles or reduces their range. Li-NMC batteries using lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides are the most common in EV. The lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP) is on the rise, reaching 41% global market share by capacity for BEVs in 2023. [ 1 ] : 85 LFP batteries are heavier but cheaper and more sustainable. However, some commercial passenger car manufacturers are now beginning to use a sodium-ion battery completely avoiding the need for critical minerals. [ 2 ] The battery makes up a significant portion of the cost and environmental impact of an electric vehicle. Growth in the industry has generated interest in securing ethical battery supply chains , which presents many challenges and has become an important geopolitical issue. Reduction of use of mined cobalt , which is also required in fossil fuel refining, has been a major goal of research. A number of new chemistries compete to displace Li-NMC with (see solid-state battery ) performance above 800Wh/kg in laboratory testing. As of December 2019 [update] , despite more reliance on recycled materials the cost of electric vehicle batteries has fallen 87% since 2010 on a per kilowatt-hour basis. [ 3 ] Demand for EVBs exceeded 750 GWh in 2023. [ 1 ] EVBs have much higher capacities than automotive batteries used for starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) in combustion cars. The average battery capacity of available EV models reached from 21 to 123 kWh in 2023 with an average of 80 kWh. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Electric vehicle battery types [ edit ] A man cutting open a lithium-ion battery for use in an electric vehicle See also: Comparison of commercial battery types As of 2024, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) with the variants Li-NMC, LFP and Li-NCA dominates the BEV market. The combined global production capacity in 2023 reached almost 2000 GWh with 772 GWh used for EVs in 2023. Most production is based in China where capacities increased by 45% that year. [ 1 ] : 17 With their high energy density and long cycle life, lithium-ion batteries have become the leading battery type for use in EVs. They were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. Recent EVs are using new variations on lithium-ion chemistry that sacrifice specific energy and specific power to provide fire resistance, environmental friendliness, rapid charging and longer lifespans. These variants have been shown to have a much longer lifetime. For example, lithium-ion cells containing single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) show increased mechanical strength, suppressing degradation and leading to a longer battery lifetime.

On the other hand, the exploitation of the required minerals causes environmental problems. The downside of traditional NMC batteries includes sensitivity to temperature, low temperature power performance, and performance degradation with age. [ 27 ] Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly. Early cells did not accept or supply charge when extremely cold. Heaters can be used in some climates to warm them. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) [ edit ] The Lithium iron phosphate battery has a shorter range but is cheaper, safer and more sustainable than the NMC battery. [ 28 ] It does not require the critical minerals manganese and cobalt .
Since 2023, LFP has become the leading technology in China while the market share in Europe and North America remains lower than 10%. [ 1 ] : 86 LFP is the dominant type in grid energy storage . Lithium Titanate (LTO) [ edit ] Lithium titanate or lithium-titanium-oxide (LTO) batteries are known for their high safety profile, with reduced risk of thermal runaway and effective operation over a wide temperature range. [ 29 ] LTO batteries have an impressive cycle life, often exceeding 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. [ 30 ] They also have rapid charging capabilities due to their high charge acceptance. [ 31 ] However, they have a lower energy density compared to other lithium-ion batteries . [ 32 ] Sodium-ion [ edit ] The Sodium-ion battery completely avoids critical materials. [ 33 ] Due to the high availability of sodium which is a part of salt water, cost projections are low. In early 2024, various Chinese manufacturers began with the delivery of their first models. [ 2 ] Analysts see a high potential for this type especially for the use in small EVs, bikes and three-wheelers. [ 34 ] Future types [ edit ] Several types are in development. The solid-state battery could offer high energy density and potential safety improvements. [ 8 ] : 26 The lithium-sulfur battery is also expected to meet high performance demands. The LMFP battery is a LFP battery that includes manganese as a cathode component. Legacy types [ edit ] Lead-acid [ edit ] In the 20th century most electric vehicles used a flooded lead–acid battery due to their mature technology, high availability, and low cost. Lead–acid batteries powered such early modern EVs as the original 1996 versions of the EV1 . There are two main types of lead–acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and deep-cycle batteries which provide continuous electricity to run electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts. [ 35 ] Deep-cycle batteries are also used as auxiliary batteries in recreational vehicles, but they require different, multi-stage charging. Discharging below 50% can shorten the battery's life. [ 36 ] Flooded batteries require inspection of electrolyte levels and occasional replacement of water, which gases away during the normal charging cycle. EVs with lead–acid batteries are capable of up to 130 km (81 mi) per charge. Nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) [ edit ] Main article: Nickel–metal hydride battery GM Ovonic NiMH battery module Nickel–metal hydride batteries are considered a mature technology . [ 37 ] While less efficient (60–70%) in charging and discharging than even lead–acid, they have a higher specific energy of 30–80 W·h/kg. When used properly, nickel–metal hydride batteries can have exceptionally long lives, as has been demonstrated in their use in hybrid cars and in the surviving first-generation NiMH Toyota RAV4 EVs that still operate well after 100,000 miles (160,000 km) and over a decade of service. Downsides include finicky charge cycles and poor performance in cold weather. [ citation needed ] GM Ovonic produced the NiMH battery used in the second generation EV-1. [ 38 ] Prototype NiMH-EVs delivered up to 200 km (120 mi) of range. Zebra [ edit ] Main article: Molten salt battery The sodium nickel chloride or ""Zebra"" battery was used in early EVs between 1997 and 2012. It uses a molten sodium chloroaluminate (NaAlCl 4 ) salt as the electrolyte. It has a specific energy of 120 W·h/kg. Since the battery must be heated for use, cold weather does not strongly affect its operation except for increasing heating costs. Zebra batteries can last for a few thousand charge cycles and are nontoxic. The downsides to the Zebra battery include poor specific power (<300 W/kg) and the need to heat the electrolyte to about 270 °C (518 °F), which wastes some energy, presents difficulties in long-term storage of charge, and is potentially a hazard. [ 39 ] Other legacy types [ edit ] Other types of rechargeable batteries used in early electric vehicles include nickel–cadmium Nickel–iron battery used in the Detroit Electric Lithium vanadium oxide made its way into the Subaru prototype G4e . [ 40 ] Battery architecture and integration [ edit ] CTx series: Cell to Module (CTM) - battery cells put into modules, than into battery pack Cell to Pack (CTP) - battery cells into battery pack without modules Cell to Chassis (CTC) - battery cells into frame or chassis , batteries maybe used as part of structural integrity or to increase structural strength Cell to Body (CTB) - battery cells into vehicle body [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Supply chain [ edit ] Geographical distribution of the global battery supply chain [ 8 ] : 58 See also: Electric vehicle supply chain Lifecycle of lithium-based EV batteries [ edit ] During the first stage, the materials [ 44 ] are mined in different parts of the world, including Australia , [ 45 ] Russia , [ 46 ] New Caledonia and Indonesia . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] All the following steps are currently dominated by China . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] After the materials are refined by pre-processing factories, battery manufacturing companies buy them, make batteries, and assemble them into packs.  Car manufacturing companies buy and install them in cars. To address the environmental impact of this process, the supply chain is increasingly focusing on sustainability, with efforts to reduce reliance on rare-earth minerals and improve recycling. [ 51 ] Manufacturing [ edit ] Manufacturing process of EV batteries There are mainly three stages during the manufacturing process of EV batteries: materials manufacturing, cell manufacturing and integration, as shown in Manufacturing process of EV batteries graph in grey, green and orange color respectively. This shown process does not include manufacturing of cell hardware, i.e. casings and current collectors. During the materials manufacturing process, the active material, conductivity additives, polymer binder and solvent are mixed first. After this, they are coated on the current collectors ready for the drying process. During this stage, the methods of making active materials depend on the electrode and the chemistry. Cathodes mostly use transition metal oxides, i.e. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (Li-NMC), or else Lithium metal phosphates, i.e. Lithium iron phosphates (LFP).  The most popular material for anodes is graphite.  However, recently there have been a lot of companies started to make Si mixed anode ( Sila Nanotech , ProLogium ) and Li metal anode ( Cuberg , Solid Power ). In general, for active materials production, there are three steps: materials preparation, materials processing and refinement. Schmuch et al. discussed materials manufacturing in greater details. [ 52 ] In the cell manufacturing stage, the prepared electrode will be processed to the desired shape for packaging in a cylindrical, rectangular or pouch format. Then after filling the electrolytes and sealing the cells, the battery cells are cycled carefully to form SEI protecting the anode. Then, these batteries are assembled into packs ready for vehicle integration. Reusing and repurposing [ edit ] Examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. Adapted from Awan [ 53 ] For electric vehicles (EVs), actual end of life will be defined by many factors that will vary across vehicles, including the owner's willingness to continue driving the EV as its range declines, the health of other components in the vehicle, and whether or not the vehicle is involved in a crash. For practicality, however, end of life is commonly defined in repurposing studies as when a battery's capacity degrades to 80% of its initial capacity. [ 54 ] This likely comes from the U.S. American Battery Consortium definition: ""End-of-life is clarified to occur when either the net DST delivered capacity or peak power capability at 80% DOD is less than 80% of rated."" [ 55 ] One of the waste management methods is to reuse the pack. By repurposing the pack for stationary storage, more value can be extracted from the battery pack while reducing the per kWh lifecycle impact. Uneven and undesired battery degradation happens during EV operation depending on temperature during operation and charging/discharging patterns. Each battery cell could degrade differently during operation. Currently, the state of health (SOH) information from a battery management system (BMS) can be extracted on a pack level but not on a cell level. Engineers can mitigate the degradation by engineering the next-generation thermal management system. electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to ensure the quality of the battery pack. [ 53 ] [ 56 ] It is costly and time-intensive to disassemble modules and cells. The module must be fully discharged. Then, the pack must be disassembled and reconfigured to meet the power and energy requirement of the second life application. A refurbishing company can sell or reuse the discharged energy from the module to reduce the cost of this process. Robots are being used to increase the safety of the dismantling process. [ 53 ] [ 57 ] Battery technology is non-transparent and lacks standards. Because battery development is the core part of EV, it is difficult for the manufacturer to label the exact chemistry of cathode, anode and electrolytes on the pack. In addition, the capacity and the design of the cells and packs changes on a yearly basis. The refurbishing company needs to closely work with the manufacture to have a timely update on this information. On the other hand, government can set up labeling standard. [ 53 ] Lastly, battery costs have decreased faster than predicted. The refurbished unit may be less attractive than the new batteries to the market. [ 53 ] Nonetheless, there have been several successes on the second-life application as shown in the examples of storage projects using second-life EV batteries. They are used in less demanding stationary storage application as peak shaving or additional storage for renewable-based generating sources. [ 53 ] Recycling [ edit ] Examples of current lithium-ion battery recycling facilities. Adapted from Awan [ 53 ] See also: Lithium-ion batteries § Solid waste and recycling Although battery life span can be extended by enabling a second-life application, ultimately EV batteries need to be recycled. Recyclability is not currently an important design consideration for battery manufacturers, and in 2019 only 5% of electric vehicle batteries were recycled. [ 58 ] However, closing the loop is extremely important. Not only because of a predicted tightened supply of nickel , cobalt and lithium in the future, also recycling EV batteries has the potential to maximize the environmental benefit. Xu et al. predicted that in the sustainable development scenario, lithium, cobalt and nickel will reach or surpass the amount of known reserves in the future if no recycling is in place. [ 59 ] Ciez and Whitacre found that by deploying battery recycling some green house gas (GHG) emission from mining could be avoided. [ 60 ] BEV technologies lack an established recycling framework in many countries, making the usage of BEV and other battery-operated electrical equipment a large energy expenditure, ultimately increasing CO 2 emissions - especially in countries lacking renewable energy resources. [ 61 ] There have been many efforts around the world to promote recycling technologies development and deployment. In the US, the Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Offices (VTO) set up two efforts targeting at innovation and practicability of recycling processes. ReCell Lithium Recycling RD center brings in three universities and three national labs together to develop innovative, efficient recycling technologies. Most notably, the direct cathode recycling method was developed by the ReCell center. On the other hand, VTO also set up the battery recycling prize to incentivize American entrepreneurs to find innovative solutions to solve current challenges. [ 62 ] Recycling of EV Batteries helps to recover valuable materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare-earth elements , reducing the need for new mining and conserving natural resources and reduces the environmental footprint associated with battery production by minimizing mining impacts, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. [ citation needed ] Recycling vs mining [ edit ] Battery recycling emissions under US average electricity grid. (a,b) for cylindrical cell and (c,d) for pouch cell. Adapted from Ciez and Whitacre. [ 60 ] To develop a deeper understanding of the lifecycle of EV batteries, it is important to analyze the emission associated with different phases. Using NMC cylindrical cells as an example, Ciez and Whitacre found that around 9 kg CO 2 e kg battery − 1 is emitted during raw materials pre-processing and battery manufacturing under the US average electricity grid. The biggest part of the emission came from materials preparation accounting for more than 50% of the emissions. If NMC pouch cell is used, the total emission increases to almost 10 kg CO 2 e kg battery − 1 while materials manufacturing still contributes to more than 50% of the emission. [ 60 ] During the end-of-life management phase, the refurbishing process adds little emission to the lifecycle emission. The recycling process, on the other hand, as suggested by Ciez and Whitacre emits a significant amount of GHG. As shown in the battery recycling emission plot a and c, the emission of the recycling process varies with the different recycling processes, different chemistry and different form factor. Thus, the net emission avoided compared to not recycling also varies with these factors. At a glance, as shown in the plot b and d, the direct recycling process is the most ideal process for recycling pouch cell batteries, while the hydrometallurgical process is most suitable for cylindrical type battery. However, with the error bars shown, the best approach cannot be picked with confidence. It is worth noting that for the lithium iron phosphates (LFP) chemistry, the net benefit is negative. Because LFP cells lacks cobalt and nickel which are expensive and energy intensive to produce, it is more energetically efficient to mine. In general, in addition to promoting the growth of a single sector, a more integrated effort should be in place to reduce the lifecycle emission of EV batteries. A finite total supply of rare earth material can apparently justify the need for recycling. But the environmental benefit of recycling needs closer scrutiny. Based on current recycling technology, the net benefit of recycling depends on the form factors, the chemistry and the recycling process chosen. Environmental impact [ edit ] Transition to electric vehicles is estimated to require 87 times more than 2015 of specific metals by 2060 that need to be mined initially, with recycling covering part of the demand in future. [ 63 ] According to IEA 2021 study, mineral supplies need to increase from 400 kilotonnes in 2020 to 11,800 kilotonnes in 2040 in order to cover the demand by EV. This increase creates a number of key challenges, from supply chain as 60% of production is concentrated in China to significant impact on climate [ need quotation to verify ] and environment as result of such a large increase in mining operations. [ 64 ] However 45% of oil demand in 2022 was for road transport, and batteries may reduce this to 20% by 2050, [ 65 ] which would save hundreds of times more raw material than that used to make the batteries. [ 66 ] Distributive and energy injustice concerns persist as resource-rich but economically disadvantaged  communities bear social and ecological costs while wealthier nations benefit from these technologies. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Scholars described these regions as sacrifice zones , where Indigenous and low-income groups experience slow violence and environmental degradation . [ 69 ] [ 70 ] In many cases, mining projects proceed without meaningful consultation/consent, leaving local communities without a voice in decisions impacting them, highlighting issues in procedural injustice . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Regulatory policies, like the DRC Mining Code [ 74 ] and OECD Due Diligence Guidance , [ 75 ] aim to address issues, but face weak enforcement, corruption, and non-binding commitments that limited their effectiveness. Rising demand for EV batteries has intensified mining for nickel , copper , lithium , and cobalt , particularly in developing countries including the Philippines , [ 76 ] the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) , [ 77 ] Chile , [ 78 ] [ 79 ] and Indonesia . [ 80 ] Nickel mining in Indonesia has caused significant deforestation and heavy metal contamination in rivers, affecting communities reliant on these ecosystems. [ 81 ] [ 73 ] [ 82 ] In the DRC, mining exposes marginalized groups to elevated levels of toxic metals in the air, water, and soil, with little compensation or protection and lack the power to influence mining regulations or demand better working conditions. [ 77 ] In Chile's Salar de Atacama , lithium extraction consumes 65% of the region's freshwater supply, worsening droughts and impacting Indigenous communities. [ 78 ] [ 83 ] Producing one metric ton of lithium requires 400,000 to 2 million liters (100,000-500,000 gallons) of water. [ 78 ] [ 84 ] In January 2024, Indigenous-led protests blocked mining operations, demanding inclusion in decision-making regarding the salt flats . [ 85 ] Concerns remain over the lack of adherence to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) in affected communities. [ 86 ] Battery cost [ edit ] Main article: Rechargeable battery § Price history Average battery costs fell by 90% between 2010 and 2024 due to advances in battery chemistry and manufacturing. [ 8 ] : 3 Batteries represent a substantial portion of an EV's overall cost, often accounting for up to 30-40% of the vehicle's total price. [ citation needed ] However, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing steadily over the years due to advancements in technology, economies of scale, and improvements in manufacturing processes. EV batteries typically come with warranties covering a certain number of years or miles, reflecting confidence in their durability and reliability over time. [ citation needed ] The cost of lithium-ion battery packs remains a primary barrier to the widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), particularly in achieving cost parity with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). A large fraction—around 70%—of the total battery cost is attributed to the materials used in the cell, with cathodes alone accounting for 40–45% of this material cost. [ 87 ] The high price volatility of raw materials, particularly nickel and cobalt, significantly affects the cost of cathode active materials (CAMs), which in turn influences the overall cost of battery packs. Recent [ when? ] models take a bottom-up approach, calculating battery costs from raw metal prices rather than relying on fixed CAM prices. This approach reveals how fluctuations in cobalt and nickel prices impact the costs of CAMs such as NMC, NCA, LMO, LNMO, and LFP. The shift to higher nickel cathodes (e.g., NMC811, NCA) has been shown to reduce material costs by enhancing energy density and reducing cobalt content. [ 88 ] Techno-economic analyses show that BEVs with larger energy requirements (e.g., 320 km, 200-mile range) benefit from lower per-kWh costs due to the use of thicker electrodes and improved economies of scale. For instance, pack-level costs can range from approximately $545/kWh for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV10) to around $230/kWh for BEV200 vehicles. [ 89 ] These reductions are more significant than those achieved by optimistic process improvements alone. Economies of scale play a crucial role in reducing battery costs, though significant reductions plateau beyond production volumes of 200–300 MWh per year. [ 90 ] Further reductions may require increases in plant size, improved roll-to-roll electrode manufacturing, and higher equipment utilization rates. Minimum viable plant sizes currently stand below 2 GWh/year but may need to exceed 15 GWh/year in the future to sustain cost efficiency and market growth. [ 91 ] EV parity [ edit ] Battery prices fell, given economies of scale and new cell chemistries improving energy density. [ 92 ] However, general inflationary pressures, and rising costs of raw materials and components, inhibited price declines in the early 2020s. [ 92 ] Cost parity [ edit ] See also: Electric vehicle conversion One issue is purchase price, the other issue is total cost of ownership. Total cost of ownership of electric cars is often less than petrol or diesel cars. [ 93 ] In 2024 Gartner predicted that by 2027, next-generation BEVs will, on average, be cheaper to produce than a comparable ICE“. [ 94 ] In China, BEV are now cheaper than comparable combustion cars. [ 95 ] The development is driven by subsidies in the Chinese market. The USA are protecting their own manufacturers with tariffs , in the EU this is debated. This can delay cost parity. Range parity [ edit ] The weight of the electric vehicle battery is the limiting factor to reach range parity. Diesel and gasoline have more than the 50-fold  energy density of current EV batteries. energy density kWh/t typical consumption per 100 km weight per 100 km Diesel 12600 [ 96 ] 7 litres ~ 72 kWh ~6 kg EV battery 165 [ 1 ] : 166 20 kWh ~120 kg In practical use, charging speed is more relevant than battery capacity (see recharging section).
Typical EV batteries in passenger cars have a weight of 300 to 1,000 kg (660 to 2,200 lb) [ 97 ] resulting in ranges from 150 to 500 km (90 to 310 miles), depending on temperature, driving style and car type. Even with the same range as an average all-combustion vehicle, buyers must be assured that there are widely available and compatible charging stations for their vehicles. [ 98 ] As of 2024 [update] the range of electric ships and large planes is less than combustion engined ones. To electrify all shipping standardized multi-megawatt charging is needed. [ 99 ] But sometimes batteries can be swapped, for example for river shipping. [ 100 ] As of 2024 [update] pure electric large plane ranges of over 1000 km are not expected within a decade - meaning that for over half of scheduled flights  range parity cannot be achieved. [ 101 ] Specifics [ edit ] Internal components [ edit ] Battery pack on the roof of a battery electric bus Electric truck e-Force One. Battery pack between the axles. Cylindrical cell (18650) prior to assembly Lithium ion battery monitoring electronics (overcharge and over-discharge protection) Battery pack designs for electric vehicles (EVs) are complex and vary widely by manufacturer and specific application. However, they all incorporate a combination of several simple mechanical and electrical component systems which perform the basic required functions of the pack. [ citation needed ] The actual battery cells can have different chemistry, physical shapes, and sizes as preferred by various pack manufacturers. Battery packs will always incorporate many discrete cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the total voltage and current requirements of the pack. Battery packs for all electric drive EVs can contain several hundred individual cells. Each cell has a nominal voltage of 3-4 volts , depending on its chemical composition. [ citation needed ] To assist in manufacturing and assembly, the large stack of cells is typically grouped into smaller stacks called modules. Several of these modules are placed into a single pack. Within each module the cells are welded together to complete the electrical path for current flow. Modules can also incorporate cooling mechanisms, temperature monitors, and other devices. Modules must remain within a specific temperature range for optimal performance. [ 102 ] In most cases, modules also allow for monitoring the voltage produced by each battery cell in the stack by using a battery management system (BMS). [ 103 ] The battery cell stack has a main fuse which limits the current of the pack under a short circuit. A ""service plug"" or ""service disconnect"" can be removed to split the battery stack into two electrically isolated halves. With the service plug removed, the exposed main terminals of the battery present no high potential electrical danger to service technicians. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The battery pack also contains relays, or contactors, which control the distribution of the battery pack's electrical power to the output terminals. In most cases there will be a minimum of two main relays which connect the battery cell stack to the main positive and negative output terminals of the pack, which then supply high current to the electrical drive motor. Some pack designs include alternate current paths for pre-charging the drive system through a pre-charge resistor or for powering an auxiliary bus which will also have their own associated control relays. For safety reasons these relays are all normally open. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The battery pack also contains a variety of temperature, voltage, and current sensors. Collection of data from the pack sensors and activation of the pack relays are accomplished by the pack's battery monitoring unit (BMU) or BMS. The BMS is also responsible for communications with the vehicle outside the battery pack. [ 103 ] Recharging [ edit ] Batteries in BEVs must be periodically recharged. BEVs charge from the power grid at home or using a recharging point . The energy is generated from a variety of domestic resources, such as coal , hydroelectricity , nuclear , natural gas , photovoltaic solar cell panels and wind . With suitable power supplies, good battery lifespan is usually achieved at charging rates not exceeding half of the capacity of the battery per hour ( ""0.5 C "" ), [ 105 ] thereby taking two or more hours for a full charge, but faster charging is available even for large capacity batteries. [ 106 ] Charging time at home is limited by the capacity of the household electrical outlet , unless specialized electrical wiring work is done. In the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 120 V electricity, a normal household outlet delivers 1.5 kilowatts . In other countries with 230 V electricity between 7 and 14 kilowatts can be delivered (230 V single phase and 400 V three-phase, respectively). In Europe, a 400 V (three-phase 230 V) grid connection is increasingly popular since newer houses don't have natural gas connection due to the European Union's safety regulations. [ citation needed ] New data has shown that exposure to heat and the use of fast charging promote the degradation of Li-ion batteries more than age and actual use, and that the average electric vehicle battery will retain 90% of its initial capacity after six years and six months of service. For example, the battery in a Nissan Leaf will degrade twice as fast as the battery in a Tesla, because the Leaf does not have an active cooling system for its battery. [ 107 ] A December 2024 study published in Nature Energy has prompted significant discussion within the scientific and automotive communities regarding the longevity of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The research suggests that EV batteries, in real-world conditions, may last up to a third longer than previously estimated under laboratory conditions. This finding challenges the assumption that laboratory tests, conducted under controlled and often harsher conditions, accurately predict battery life in everyday use. [ 108 ] Recharging time [ edit ] EV charging curves at 300 kW chargers [ 109 ] With rapid recharging, the concern about limited travel ranges loses relevance as the duration of a stops at public charging stations can be minimized. There is a growing electric vehicle charging network [ 110 ] with DC powers of 150 kW and more which can add up to 300 km of range within a typical 30 minute break. Charging speed depends on the power of the charging station and the maximum load which the specific EV model can handle. At charging states over 50%, charging speed generally slows down. Typical rapid charging powers are between 30 and 80 kW. [ 109 ] Charging at home or smaller charging stations using alternating current usually takes several hours.
The table assumes a typical consumption of 15 kWh per 100 km and takes into account that drivers should take a break every 300 km anyway. Duration for refuelling / charging 300 km (45 kWh) type maximum power average power time Diesel / Gasoline 5-10 min Tesla model Y 250 kW 87.7 kW (10-90%) [ 111 ] 31 min VW e-Up 37 kW 30 KW [ 112 ] 90 min (2 stops) Connectors [ edit ] The charging power can be connected to the car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as conductive coupling . This might be as simple as a mains lead into a weatherproof socket through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from high voltages . The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the SAE 1772 conductive connector (IEC 62196 Type 1) in the US. The ACEA has chosen the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 (IEC 62196 Type 2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a latch, means unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism. [ citation needed ] The second approach is known as inductive charging . A special 'paddle' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a transformer , while the other is built into the car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one inductive charging system, one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays on the floor of the garage. The advantage of the inductive approach is that there is no possibility of electrocution as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and ground fault detectors can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. Inductive charging can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry offboard. [ 113 ] An inductive charging advocate from Toyota contended in 1998, that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging advocate from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient. [ 113 ] Recharging spots [ edit ] Main article: Charging station As of June 2024 [update] , there more than 200,000 locations and 400,000 EV charging stations worldwide. [ 114 ] Travel range before recharging [ edit ] The range of a BEV depends on the number and type of batteries used. The weight and type of vehicle as well as terrain, weather, and the performance of the driver also have an impact, just as they do on the mileage of traditional vehicles . Electric vehicle conversion performance depends on a number of factors including the battery chemistry. Lithium-ion battery-equipped EVs provide 320–540 km (200–340 mi) of range per charge. [ 115 ] The internal resistance of some batteries may be significantly increased at low temperature [ 116 ] which can cause noticeable reduction in the range of the vehicle and on the lifetime of the battery. With an AC system or advanced DC system, regenerative braking can extend range by up to 50% under extreme traffic conditions without complete stopping. Otherwise, the range is extended by about 10 to 15% in city driving, and only negligibly in highway driving, depending upon terrain. [ citation needed ] BEVs (including buses and trucks) can also use genset trailers and pusher trailers in order to extend their range when desired without the additional weight during normal short range use. Discharged basket trailers can be replaced by recharged ones en route. If rented then maintenance costs can be deferred to the agency. Trailers [ edit ] Auxiliary battery capacity carried in trailers can increase the overall vehicle range, but also increases the loss of power arising from aerodynamic drag , increases weight transfer effects and reduces traction capacity. Swapping and removing [ edit ] Main article: Battery swapping An alternative to recharging is to exchange drained or nearly drained batteries (or battery range extender modules ) with fully charged batteries. This is called battery swapping and is done in exchange stations . [ 117 ] Features of swap stations include: [ 118 ] The consumer is no longer concerned with battery capital cost, life cycle, technology, maintenance, or warranty issues; Swapping is far faster than charging: battery swap equipment built by the firm Better Place has demonstrated automated swaps in less than 60 seconds; [ 119 ] Swap stations increase the feasibility of distributed energy storage via the electric grid; Concerns about swap stations include: Potential for fraud (battery quality can only be measured over a full discharge cycle; battery lifetime can only be measured over repeated discharge cycles; those in the swap transaction cannot know if they are getting a worn or reduced effectiveness battery; battery quality degrades slowly over time, so worn batteries will be gradually forced into the system) Manufacturers' unwillingness to standardize open-source hardware battery access and implementation details, [ 120 ] so users must find a proprietary station Safety concerns [ 120 ] Vehicle-to-grid [ edit ] Main article: Vehicle-to-grid Smart grid allows BEVs to provide power to the grid at any time, especially: During peak load periods (When the selling price of electricity can be very high. Vehicles can then be recharged during off-peak hours at cheaper rates which helps absorb excess night time generation. The vehicles serve as a distributed battery storage system to buffer power.) During blackouts , as backup power sources. Safety [ edit ] The safety issues of battery electric vehicles are largely dealt with by the international standard ISO 6469 . This standard is divided into three parts: On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery Functional safety means and protection against failures Protection of persons against electrical hazards. Firefighters and rescue personnel receive special training to deal with the higher voltages and chemicals encountered in electric and hybrid electric vehicle accidents. While BEV accidents may present unusual problems, such as fires and fumes resulting from rapid battery discharge, many experts agree that BEV batteries are safe in commercially available vehicles and in rear-end collisions, and are safer than gasoline-propelled cars with rear gasoline tanks. [ 121 ] Usually, battery performance testing includes the determination of: State of charge (SOC) State of Health (SOH) Energy Efficiency Performance testing simulates the drive cycles for the drive trains of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as per the required specifications of car manufacturers ( OEMs ). During these drive cycles, controlled cooling of the battery can be performed, simulating the thermal conditions in the car. In addition, climatic chambers control environmental conditions during testing and allow simulation of the full automotive temperature range and climatic conditions. [ 35 ] Patents [ edit ] See also: open hardware and patent encumbrance of large automotive NiMH batteries Patents may be used to suppress development or deployment of battery technology. For example, patents relevant to the use of Nickel metal hydride cells in cars were held by an offshoot of Chevron Corporation , a petroleum company, who maintained veto power over any sale or licensing of NiMH technology. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Research, development and innovation [ edit ] As of December 2019, billions of euro in research are planned to be invested around the world for improving batteries. [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Researchers have come up with some design considerations for contactless BEV chargers. Inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) systems are made to transfer power efficiently from a primary source (charging station) to one or more secondary sources (BEVs) in a contactless way via magnetic coupling. [ 126 ] Europe has plans for heavy investment in electric vehicle battery development and production, and Indonesia also aims to produce electric vehicle batteries in 2023, inviting Chinese battery firm GEM and Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd to invest in Indonesia. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ] [ 133 ] [ 134 ] Ultracapacitors [ edit ] Electric double-layer capacitors (or ""ultracapacitors"") are used in some electric vehicles, such as AFS Trinity's concept prototype, to store rapidly available energy with their high specific power , in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery life. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Since commercially available ultracapacitors have a low specific energy, no production electric cars use ultracapacitors exclusively. In January 2020, Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla , stated that the advancements in Li-ion battery technology have made ultra-capacitors unnecessary for electric vehicles. [ 137 ] Promotion in the United States [ edit ] On 2 May 2022, President Biden announced the administration will begin a $3.16 billion plan to boost domestic manufacturing and recycling of batteries, in a larger effort to shift the country away from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. The goal of the Biden administration is to have half of U.S. automobile production electric by 2030. [ 138 ] The Inflation Reduction Act , passed on 16 August 2022, aimed to incentivize clean energy manufacturing with a $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs with US-built batteries, and subsidies for EV plants. By October 2022, billions of dollars of investment had been announced for over two dozen US battery plants, leading some commentators to nickname the Midwest as the ""Battery Belt"".

Gallery Show all 24 photos Sports cars can sometimes feel like gilded cages. High-performance vehicles’ enormous power and potential often serve as more of a reminder of the limits of civil commuting than a source of driving joy. Sure, a Porsche 911 can reach a top speed of 291 km/h, but it’s limited to the same effective top speed as a Toyota RAV4 on public roads. But at the Porsche Experience Centre (PEC) Toronto, drivers are handed the keys to a Porsche and to the lock on their gold-lined confines. The first Porsche Experience Centre in Canada, and only the 10 th globally, is located just outside of Toronto, in Ajax, Ont., and is part of the automaker’s ecosystem of driver engagement offerings that have been building since the first PEC opened in Silverstone, U.K., in 2008. Neither a racetrack nor dealership, the centre serves as a playground on which Porsche customers (and anyone with a moderately large stack of cash burning a hole in their pocket) can experience what the brand has to offer in a safe place that features a skid pad, a low-friction circuit, an open asphalt pad, and a 2-km track that features corners inspired by some ",N,N,N

Nissan and Toyota want to commercialize solid-state batteries in the next two years. Challenges remain, including timeline delays and technological hurdles for mass production. Solid-state batteries have been the big promise in the EV world for years now. Enthusiasts and experts alike have predicted they would render current battery chemistries like LFP and NMC practically obsolete by this point. So far, though, we’re still waiting for that promised breakthrough. Still, the world’s largest carmakers aren’t ready to give up on them just yet. Companies like BMW , Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis continue to pour resources into solid-state tech, lured by the possibility of EVs that could travel over 1,000 km (621 miles) on a single charge. BMW recently started testing a specially-equipped i7 prototype in Munich with large-format solid-state cells from US company Solid Power. These cells use sulfide-based electrolytes and will be used in future Neue Klasse models from the automaker. But it won’t be until the 2030s that mass production of these cars begins. Read: Mercedes EQS Solid State Prototype Hits The Street With 621 Miles Of Range Cross-town rival Mercedes-Benz is also working on solid-state EVs of its own. It started real-world testing of a retrofitted EQS in February, using a battery from Factorial Energy, a company Mercedes has been working with for several years. According to Auto News , this new battery will have 25% higher energy than current packs. It’ll also be lighter and more compact. This will also impact the designs of future Mercedes models with solid-state packs, according to the company’s head of battery development, Uwe Keller. “[These benefits] not only lead to longer vehicle ranges but also affect the vehicle design, for example the architecture,” he revealed. “Solid state cells are also less prone to overheating.” Stellantis is also making moves to bring solid-state batteries to the market. Like Mercedes, it’s working with Factorial Energy on the project and will start tests in 2026. According to the senior vice president of tech research at Stellantis, Anne Laliron, “Solid state is the North Star in battery chemistry,” allowing car brands to choose between “more range or fewer materials – both reduce cost and carbon footprint.” While it’s unclear when Stellantis will bring the tech to the road, both Toyota and Nissan believe they can commercialize solid-state batteries in the very near future. Toyota is targeting production in 2027, while Nissan says it can launch a solid-state battery by 2028. However, given the turmoil Nissan currently finds itself in, we wouldn’t be shocked to see that date get pushed back.

Electricity Basics Benefits & Considerations Stations Vehicles Availability Conversions Emissions Batteries Maintenance & Safety School Bus Education For Fleets For Consumers Laws & Incentives Batteries for Electric Vehicles Most plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries like these. Energy storage systems, usually batteries, are essential for all-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Types of Energy Storage Systems The following energy storage systems are used in all-electric vehicles, PHEVs, and HEVs. Lithium-Ion Batteries Lithium-ion batteries are currently used in most portable consumer electronics such as cell phones and laptops because of their high energy per unit mass and volume relative to other electrical energy storage systems. They also have a high power-to-weight ratio, high energy efficiency, good high-temperature performance, long life, and low self-discharge. Most components of lithium-ion batteries can be recycled, but the cost of material recovery remains a challenge for the industry. Most of today's all-electric vehicles and PHEVs use lithium-ion batteries, though the exact chemistry often varies from that of consumer electronics batteries. Research and development are ongoing to reduce their relatively high cost, extend their useful life, use less cobalt, and address safety concerns in regard to various fault conditions. Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries Nickel-metal hydride batteries, used routinely in computer and medical equipment, offer reasonable specific energy and power capabilities. Nickel-metal hydride batteries have a much longer life cycle than lead-acid batteries and are safe and abuse-tolerant. These batteries have been widely used in HEVs . The main challenges with nickel-metal hydride batteries are their high cost, high self-discharge rate, heat generation at high temperatures, and the need to control hydrogen loss. Lead-Acid Batteries Lead-acid batteries can be designed to be high power and are inexpensive, safe, recyclable, and reliable. However, low specific energy, poor cold-temperature performance, and short calendar and lifecycle impede their use. Advanced high-power lead-acid batteries are being developed, but these batteries are only used in commercially available electric vehicles for ancillary loads. They are also used for stop-start functionality in internal combustion engine vehicles to eliminate idling during stops and reduce fuel consumption. Ultracapacitors Ultracapacitors store energy in the interface between an electrode and an electrolyte when voltage is applied. Energy storage capacity increases as the electrolyte-electrode surface area increases. Although ultracapacitors have low energy density, they have very high power density, which means they can deliver high amounts of power in a short time.  Ultracapacitors can provide vehicles with additional power during acceleration and hill climbing and help recover braking energy. They may also be useful as secondary energy-storage devices in electric vehicles because they help electrochemical batteries level load power. Recycling Batteries Electric vehicles are relatively new to the U.S. auto market, so only a small number of them have approached the end of their useful lives. As electric vehicles become increasingly common, the battery recycling market may expand. Studies have shown that an electric vehicle battery could have at least 70% of its initial capacity left at the end of its life if it has not failed or been damaged. The remaining capacity can be more than sufficient for most energy storage applications, and the battery can continue to work for another 10 years or more. Many studies have concluded that end-of-life electric vehicle batteries are technically feasible for second-use applications such as stationary grid and backup power applications. Although there are viable business models for high-value, small, and niche applications for second-use batteries (i.e., powering forklifts and portable devices, replacing diesel backup generators, acting as after-market replacement packs for electric vehicles), the economic viability of installing second-life batteries is still evolving. Costs associated with the purchase price of end-of-life batteries include transportation, storage, sorting and testing, remanufacturing, reassembly and repurposing, integration into battery energy storage systems, certification, and installation. Widespread battery recycling would help keep hazardous materials from entering the waste stream, both at the end of a battery's useful life and during its production. The U.S. Department of Energy is also supporting the Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Prize to develop and demonstrate profitable solutions for collecting, sorting, storing, and transporting spent and discarded lithium-ion batteries for eventual recycling and materials recovery. After collection of spent batteries, the material recovery from recycling would also reintroduce critical materials back into the supply chain and increase the domestic sources for such materials. Work is now underway to develop battery recycling processes that minimize the life cycle impacts of using lithium-ion and other kinds of batteries in vehicles. But not all recycling processes are the same, and different methods of separation are required for material recovery. To recover valuable materials from lithium-ion batteries, there are three major technologies currently in different stages of commercialization: smelting (pyrometallurgy), chemical leaching (hydrometallurgy), and direct recycling. In addition to these methods, mechanical treatment through disassembly, crushing, shredding, and separation to create what is called black mass is a major element of any recycling technology. Smelting (pyrometallurgy) is the process of high-temperature thermal treatment of batteries in a furnace to extract metals and intermediate salts. These can be further processed to create battery-grade precursors that could go to cathode processing facilities. Smelting (pyrometallurgy) facilities are operational on a large scale and can accept multiple kinds of batteries, including lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride. During high-temperature processing, organic materials, including the electrolyte and carbon anodes, are burned as fuel or reductant. The valuable metals and intermediate salts are recovered and sent to refining storage make them into a product suitable for any use, including battery grade processing. The other materials, including lithium, are contained in the slag, which is used as an additive in concrete. Smelting burns a significant amount of energy. Chemical leaching (hydrometallurgy) is a process using chemical treatment to extract key compounds from the black mass, including lithium compounds. The process uses leaching fluids such as inorganic acid, organic acid, alkali, or even bacteria solutions that dissolve metals in cathodes to salts that can be used as precursors to make new cathodes. Many companies in the United States and around the world are building factories for hydrometallurgy because of lower capex and flexibility to directly produce cathodes. In the next few years, several facilities will come online to recycle the onslaught of batteries being retired. Direct recycling involves the recovery of cathodes while maintaining its molecular structure rather than breaking it down into constituent metals for reprocessing into battery-grade cathode. Eliminating the need for smelting or chemical leaching makes the prospect of direct recycling most economically viable. With improvement in efficiencies and at-scale production of cathodes of the future, direct recycling factories could be a viable option. Separating the different kinds of battery materials is often a stumbling block in recovering high-value materials. Therefore, battery design that considers disassembly and recycling is important for the sustainability of electric vehicles. Standardizing batteries, materials, and cell design would also make recycling easier and more cost-effective.

Photo by: RSymons “RSEV” (YouTube) Mack Hogan By : Mack Hogan Jun 26, at 1:08pm ET Facebook X LinkedIn Flipboard Reddit WhatsApp E-Mail Share Comment R Symons Electric Vehicles, a U.K.-based electric vehicle dealer, drove two nearly identical Tesla Model 3s 200 miles for a range and efficiency test. Despite one car having 225,000 miles, it was just as efficient as the 18,000-mile example it was up against. This is good news for EV shoppers, as it's further proof that batteries and motors tend to perform well for longer than most people keep their cars. How many miles is too many? That's a question I get from car shoppers a lot. The answer is, of course, that it depends. The vehicle itself, how it was serviced and what you intend to do with it all factor in. But if you want efficient, reliable transportation and you're shopping for a Tesla Model 3, I'm starting to think that mileage doesn't matter . This video from R Symons Electric Vehicles makes the case clear. In it, the EV dealership tests a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with 18,000 miles against a nearly identical one with 225,000 miles over 200 miles of real-world driving. Both vehicles are the same age, same color and have the same wheels. The only difference is the mileage and the tires, with the high-mileage car on newer, grippier tires. It should get smoked. It doesn't. The low-mileage example returns 4.55 miles per kilowatt-hour, while the high-mileage car gets 4.51 miles per kWh. That's a great showing. The tiny variation there could be entirely explained by the tire difference, or even random chance, as it's less than 1%. Measured by what percentage of the battery both vehicles used over 200 miles, the result was ""exactly the same,"" as the host notes. Both vehicles used 65% of the battery. Get the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . Given that the 225,000-mile car still has 89% of its original battery capacity, it's not surprising that it can handle a 200-mile trip with plenty of range in reserve. Its fast-charging capability still works, too, and it's on the original motor and battery pack. To me, that's representative of a bright electric future. Because while most people don't realize this, internal-combustion engines get less efficient as time goes on. My 232,000-mile truck certainly isn't as efficient as when it was new, and it's had plenty of components, seals and hoses replaced. The fact is that gasoline engines are just far more complicated than electric powertrains, which means there's more to maintain, and more to go wrong.

It’s easy to see out of, undemanding and consumes long journeys with ease and in spectacular comfort. The massage seats are some of the best we’ve ever come across. Irrelevant? Not if you’re a parent. Little luxuries help assuage the squabbling in the back. And in the EX90 little luxuries are everywhere you look.” Read the full Volvo EX90 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk You might like 10 Here are the UK's best-selling cars of 2025... so far 13 Welcome to Top Gear's Electric Awards 2025: the best EVs in the world right now 15 Best used electric cars: 15 second-hand EVs that need to go onto your shortlist 7 Nissan Ariya Skoda Enyaq “Once more Skoda has built a car that could well be a better buy than the equivalent Volkswagen: the Enyaq edges both the ID.4 and Audi Q4 e-tron on several fronts. It drives just as well as its cousins, has a less annoying, more practical interior (particularly compared to the ID.4) and costs around the same or less than its sibling rivals. Best try all three before you commit to buying, but we know where we’d spend our money.” Read the full Skoda Enyaq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Polestar 2 “We love the Polestar 2 because it’s handsome, the build quality will give Audi drivers PTSD, and there’s a real sense of humility about the car. It’s been designed to work seamlessly, not to wow you with gimmicks then wind you up further down the line. Single Motor iterations make it more accessible for most too.” Read the full Polestar 2 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV6 “Distinctive yet unlikely to fall off a fashion cliff, rapid in a straight line but not dynamic enough to worry a proper sports car, the EV6 carves a very different path to the Hyundai Ioniq 5 with which it shares bones and blood. And that's no bad thing. But it's also spacious, quiet and a very capable cruiser, and equipped with that 800-volt architecture that makes charging station stops quick and painless. It's one of those cars that makes you think other countries are one step behind compared to what South Korea has to offer.” Read the full Kia EV6 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk BMW i5 Touring “The first all-electric executive-sized estate to the market. How did Avant kings Audi let that happen? While the four-ringed team has been asleep at the wheel, BMW has snuck in and delivered a choice of rear- or dual-motor electric luxe with a 570-litre boot. It’s refined, comfortable, easy to drive, swift, and almost too well-equipped for its own good.” Read the full BMW i5 Touring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Audi A6 Avant e-tron “We like the A6 e-tron, not least for the fact that it’s not an SUV. How refreshing. Beyond that it fulfils its brief well, carves cleanly through the air and travels a long way between charges. It’s a handsome machine that doesn’t try too hard to be an aero car, is super-smooth and refined and drives much like the big Audi saloons you’ve seen before.” Read the full Audi A6 Avant e-tron review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Renault Megane E-Tech Electric “This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it. Which is more than can be said of the ID.3.” Read the full Renault Megane Electric review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Macan “Porsche hasn’t dulled the Macan’s sheen with the switch to electric. If you want an incredibly well-rounded daily to deal with everyday life, the Macan stands out. It’s fast, comfortable, well-made and eminently practical - even more so than the ICE versions - and in Turbo form it’ll stay with a serious sportscar. “The main thrust is really the breadth of ability rather than one big headline; a comfy car in town with enough handling finesse to make it fun on a twisty bit of road. Where other mid-sized electric SUVs run out of ideas, the Macan gets going. It’s not cheap, but an absolutely solid effort from Porsche, and best-in-class.” Read the full Porsche Macan review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Fiat Grande Panda “The Grande Panda is an excellently low-cost and practical supermini – petrol or electric – with pretty special design. In a world where superminis are getting very little love from the manufacturers, that's a win. “The general aspect nods towards crossovers, and the detailing is heartwarming and original. All of which applied to the original Panda in 1980. This is a return for Fiat to doing what it has always done best.” Read the full Fiat Grande Panda review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Dacia Spring “The Spring’s appeal is that it’s everything that many electric cars aren’t: it’s not over-wrought or heavy-handed, it’s honest and enjoyable and manages to keep the dream of a low impact electric car alive and proves to everyone else it is possible for a battery electric vehicle to weigh largely the same as its petrol equivalent. Well done Dacia, let’s hope that where you lead, others will follow.” Read the full Dacia Spring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Skoda Elroq “The Skoda Elroq follows closely in the Enyaq’s footsteps, and for good reason. That car proved better than either of its VW Group siblings, and the Elroq - debuting Skoda’s new language - looks even smarter. It drives equally as well, and is just as competitively priced too. it oozes Skoda sensibility and will no doubt have competitors glancing nervously in its direction.” Read the full Skoda Elroq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Volvo EX30 “The audited CO2 footprint of a base-model EX30 out of the factory is only 18 tonnes; not much more than many petrol rivals. The UK electricity it uses to drive for an 8,000-mile year emits about 0.4 tonnes of power-station CO2, where a petrol car would emit 1.8 tonnes from its exhaust. So the EX30's lifetime CO2 is about half that of a petrol.” Read the full Volvo EX30 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV3 “The EV3 is just so roundly, crushingly competent in the same way a Golf used to be. Keenly priced and promising not to depreciate like a dropped ice lolly on a beach. Easy going and comfy to drive. Right-sized for families and not too bloated to park. It’s a roundly thought-out bit of kit as a ‘car’. And it doesn’t trip up when you factor in the ‘electric’ bit – adequate performance, strong range, and the ability to accept a speedy recharge. Not a given in an entry-level EV.” Read the full Kia EV3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk MG4 “On the face of it, the MG4 doesn’t seem like a very exciting car - certainly not something Top Gear would give a massively high score to. But when you dig into what it does for the money, how high it scores on multiple levels, it’s probably the only car in the class to recommend. It’s got range, charging, equipment, zippy dynamics and now some style.” Read the full MG4 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Tesla Model 3 / Tesla Model Y “This is the future we were promised – a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.” Read the full Tesla Model 3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk “A massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they’ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it’s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone.” Read the full Tesla Model Y review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Taycan “The Taycan can absolutely entertain on the right road and is a delight to cruise in - a GT with the heart of a sports car. More importantly, it’s a proper Porsche that just happens to run on electricity.” Read the full Porsche Taycan review , the full Taycan Cross Turismo review and the full Sport Turismo review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Rolls-Royce Spectre “Electric has enriched the Rolls-Royce. It’s still a galloping, ocean-going, 24-carat indulgence, but with a tasteful specification it’s just about possible to swerve absolute vulgarity. “It’s rich in the decadence of the so-called glory days but gratifyingly simple to operate for a product of 2023. While other manufacturers wrestle with the conundrum of transposing their family heirloom values into an electric future, the age of electric propulsion will suit Rolls-Royce very well indeed.” Read the full Rolls-Royce Spectre review Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Hyundai Ioniq 5 N “Right now, the Ioniq 5 N is an electric car that's as involving as a really good petrol car. In some ways it does that by brazenly impersonating a petrol drivetrain. The surprising thng is that's absolutely not just a gimmick. “Then in corners it has some original tricks of its own. It's not just fast, it's confident and playful so it's fun even when it's not going fast. It's useful and versatile too. “So it has many of the talents you expect from an electric car, and many more that so far are unique in EVs. Which makes us call it a new and brilliant chapter.” Read the full Hyundai Ioniq 5 N review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Renault 5 “The R5’s not the first premium-retro EV. It shares with the Mini and Fiat 500 a knowing silhouette, lavish external jewellery and a smart, cheery cabin. But it’s bigger than a Fiat 500 and goes further, and it's more practical than the Mini and copes better with bumpy roads. “It's not the cheapest EV either. But looking at performance and range, it's right in the sweet spot, and the bi-directional charging could help subsidise you outlay. Most of all it feels consistent: as charming to drive as it is to look at and to sit in. Your first love should last.” Read the full Renault 5 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Looking for more from the USA?

Whether you're searching for a sleek, contemporary wagon or a wood-paneled wagon with nostalgic style, you'll have plenty of options to choose from. Comfort and capacity The station wagon rivals the SUV for five-passenger space and comfort while also offering plenty of cargo capacity. A station wagon can carry the whole family in comfort and tote groceries, a pet or camping gear just as easily as a utility vehicle. Driving a station wagon Because it’s more aerodynamic in design, its center of gravity and its drag are lower. That means the station wagon offers greater fuel efficiency without sacrificing carrying capacity. A wagon hugs the road, which gives the handling feel of a sedan and can make it more maneuverable than a sport utility or crossover vehicle. With a variety of engine and transmission choices, today’s station wagon can be a real performance vehicle with all of the acceleration of a sedan. Top tips: Decide whether you want a new or used wagon. Do you want it for restoration? Or do you want it for immediate use? If you want the station wagon for immediate use, take it for a test-drive. Bring the family with you if you intend for the wagon to be your family car Take note of the cargo space available Check and compare the fuel economy, especially if you’re considering an SUV as an alternate option.

It seems that used car dealers have cheaper inventory. Also, some are marked as Tesla Buyback car. Are these basically Lemons?

Gallery Show all 6 photos The V12 engine is a rarity in the automotive world. Providing massive power along with enormous fuel bills, V12s are typically reserved for opulent luxury cars like Rolls-Royces or high-end performance cars like Ferraris. Sometimes, however, automakers go nuts and put large V12s in vehicles that just don’t make sense. 1. Volkswagen Touareg W12 While Volkswagen’s W12 engine is not truly a V12 in configuration, it has 12 cylinders, so we’ll go with it. The W12 was originally made for Volkswagen's failed flagship sedan, the Phaeton, which shared its platform with Audi and Bentley. Later, the W12 found a rather strange home in the Volkswagen Touareg SUV. While this decision sounds absurd, it makes sense in the automotive world of the 2000s because VW was trying to move upmarket to compete with BMW and Mercedes at the time. Offering such an opulent powertrain was bound to make some waves. The result was a Bentley-powered family SUV that produced 444 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. 2. Toyota Century V12 Toy",N,N,N

The term normally refers to a plug-in electric vehicle , typically a battery electric vehicle (BEV), which only uses energy stored in on-board battery packs , but broadly may also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), which can convert electric power from other fuels via a generator or a fuel cell . Compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, more responsive, have superior energy conversion efficiency and no exhaust emissions , as well as a typically lower overall carbon footprint from manufacturing to end of life [ 1 ] [ 2 ] (even when a fossil-fuel power plant supplying the electricity might add to its emissions). Due to the superior efficiency of electric motors, electric cars also generate less waste heat , thus reducing the need for engine cooling systems that are often large, complicated and maintenance-prone in ICE vehicles. The electric vehicle battery typically needs to be plugged into a mains electricity power supply for recharging in order to maximize the cruising range . Recharging an electric car can be done at different kinds of charging stations ; these charging stations can be installed in private homes , parking garages and public areas . [ 3 ] There is also research and development in, as well as deployment of, other technologies such as battery swapping and inductive charging . As the recharging infrastructure (especially fast chargers ) is still in its infancy, range anxiety and time cost are frequent psychological obstacles during consumer purchasing decisions against electric cars. Worldwide, 14 million plug-in electric cars were sold in 2023, 18% of new car sales, up from 14% in 2022. [ 4 ] Many countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles , tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars , [ 5 ] [ 6 ] to reduce air pollution and limit climate change . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] EVs are expected to account for over one-fifth of global car sales in 2024. [ 4 ] China currently has the largest stock of electric vehicles in the world , with cumulative sales of 5.5 million units through December 2020, [ 9 ] [ needs update ] although these figures also include heavy-duty commercial vehicles such as buses , garbage trucks and sanitation vehicles , and only accounts for vehicles manufactured in China. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In the United States and the European Union , as of 2020, the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In 2023, the Tesla Model Y became the world's best selling car. [ 18 ] The Tesla Model 3 became the world's all-time best-selling electric car in early 2020, [ 19 ] and in June 2021 became the first electric car to pass 1 million global sales. [ 20 ] Together with other emerging automotive technologies such as autonomous driving, connected vehicles and shared mobility, electric cars form a future mobility vision called Autonomous, Connected, Electric and Shared (ACES) Mobility. [ 21 ] [ page needed ] Terminology [ edit ] See also: Vehicle classification by propulsion system , Plug-in electric vehicle § Terminology , and Battery electric vehicle The term ""electric car"" typically refers specifically to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or all-electric cars, a type of electric vehicle (EV) that has an onboard rechargeable battery pack that can be plugged in and charged from the electric grid , and the electricity stored on the vehicle is the only energy source that provide propulsion for the wheels. The term generally refers to highway-capable automobiles, but there are also low-speed electric vehicles with limitations in terms of weight, power, and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on certain public roads. The latter are classified as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs) in the United States, [ 22 ] and as electric motorised quadricycles in Europe. [ 23 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of the electric vehicle Early developments [ edit ] Robert Anderson is often credited with inventing the first electric car some time between 1832 and 1839. [ 24 ] The following experimental electric cars appeared during the 1880s: In 1881, Gustave Trouvé presented an electric car driven by an improved Siemens motor at the Exposition internationale d'Électricité de Paris . [ 25 ] in 1882 Werner von Siemens presents the Electromote , the world's first trolleybus , in Berlin. In 1884, Thomas Parker built an electric car in Wolverhampton, England using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries, although the only documentation is a photograph from 1895. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 1888, the German Andreas Flocken designed the Flocken Elektrowagen , regarded by some as the first ""real"" electric car. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 1890, Andrew Morrison introduced the first electric car to the United States. [ 32 ] Electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, providing a level of comfort and an ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline-driven cars of the time. [ 33 ] The electric vehicle fleet peaked at approximately 30,000 vehicles at the turn of the 20th century. [ 34 ] In 1897, electric cars first found commercial use as taxis in Britain and in the United States. In London, Walter Bersey 's electric cabs were the first self-propelled vehicles for hire at a time when cabs were horse-drawn. [ 35 ] In New York City, a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham , based on the design of the Electrobat II , formed part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia . [ 36 ] During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the United States included Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, Bailey Electric , and Detroit Electric . Their electric vehicles were quieter than gasoline-powered ones, and did not require gear changes. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Six electric cars held the land speed record in the 19th century. [ 39 ] The last of them was the rocket-shaped La Jamais Contente , driven by Camille Jenatzy , which broke the 100 km/h (62 mph) speed barrier by reaching a top speed of 105.88 km/h (65.79 mph) in 1899. Electric cars remained popular until advances in internal-combustion engine (ICE) cars and mass production of cheaper gasoline- and diesel -powered vehicles, especially the Ford Model T , led to a decline. [ 32 ] ICE cars' much quicker refueling times and cheaper production costs made them more popular. However, a decisive moment came with the introduction in 1912 of the electric starter motor [ 40 ] that replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as hand-cranking . Gustave Trouvé 's personal electric vehicle (1881), the world's first publicly presented full-scale electric car powered by an improved Siemens motor The Electromote , the world's first trolleybus by Werner von Siemens , Berlin 1882 The Flocken Elektrowagen (1888) was the first four-wheeled electric car in the world [ 41 ] Early electric car built by Thomas Parker - photo from 1895 [ 42 ] "" La Jamais Contente "", 1899 NASA 's Lunar Roving Vehicles were battery-driven (1971) The General Motors EV1 , one of the cars introduced due to a California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandate, had a range of 260 km (160 miles) with NiMH batteries in 1999. The Tesla Roadster (2008). Modern electric cars [ edit ] In the early 1990s the California Air Resources Board (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal of a move to zero-emissions vehicles such as electric vehicles. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In response, automakers developed electric models. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market, because of a massive campaign by the US automakers to discredit the idea of electric cars. [ 45 ] California electric-automaker Tesla Motors began development in 2004 of what would become the Tesla Roadster , first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway-legal all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320 km (200 miles) per charge. [ 46 ] Better Place , a venture-backed company based in Palo Alto, California , but steered from Israel , developed and sold battery charging and battery swapping services for electric cars. The company was publicly launched on 29 October 2007 and announced deployment of electric vehicle networks in Israel , Denmark and Hawaii in 2008 and 2009. The company planned to deploy the infrastructure on a country-by-country basis. In January 2008, Better Place announced a memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan to build the world's first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) model for Israel. Under the agreement, Better Place would build the electric recharge grid and Renault-Nissan would provide the electric vehicles . Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by mismanagement, wasteful efforts to establish toeholds and run pilots in too many countries, the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, and a market penetration far lower than originally predicted. [ 47 ] Volkswagen Group has invested in a wide-ranging electrification strategy in Europe, North America and China, with its electric ""MEB"" platform . The Mitsubishi i-MiEV , launched in 2009 in Japan, was the first highway-legal series production electric car, [ 48 ] and also the first all-electric car to sell more than 10,000 units. Several months later, the Nissan Leaf , launched in 2010, surpassed the i MiEV as the best selling all-electric car at that time. [ 49 ] Starting in 2008, a renaissance in electric vehicle manufacturing occurred due to advances in batteries, and the desire to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to improve urban air quality . [ 50 ] During the 2010s, the electric vehicle industry in China expanded rapidly with government support. [ 51 ] Several automakers marked up the prices of their electric vehicles in anticipation of the subsidy adjustments, including Tesla, Volkswagen and Guangzhou-based GAC Group, which counts Fiat, Honda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and Toyota as foreign partners. [ 52 ] In July 2019 US-based Motor Trend magazine awarded the fully-electric Tesla Model S the title ""ultimate car of the year"". [ 53 ] In March 2020 the Tesla Model 3 passed the Nissan Leaf to become the world's all-time best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered; [ 19 ] it reached the milestone of 1 million global sales in June 2021. [ 20 ] The global stock of both plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has grown steadily since the 2010s. [ 54 ] Sales of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) indicate a trend away from gas-powered vehicles since 2012. [ 55 ] In the third quarter of 2021, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation reported that sales of electric vehicles had reached six percent of all US light-duty automotive sales, the highest volume of EV sales ever recorded at 187,000 vehicles. This was an 11% sales increase, as opposed to a 1.3% increase in gasoline and diesel-powered units. The report indicated that California was the US leader in EV with nearly 40% of US purchases, followed by Florida – 6%, Texas – 5% and New York 4.4%. [ 56 ] Electric companies from the Middle East have been designing electric cars. Oman's Mays Motors have developed the Mays i E1 which is expected to begin production in 2023. Built from carbon fibre, it has a range of about 560 km (350 miles) and can accelerate from 0–130 km/h (0–80 mph) in about 4 secs. [ 57 ] In Turkey, the EV company Togg is starting production of its electric vehicles. Batteries will be created in a joint venture with the Chinese company Farasis Energy . [ 58 ] Economics [ edit ] Manufacturing cost [ edit ] The most expensive part of an electric car is its battery. The price decreased from €605 per kWh in 2010, to €170 in 2017, to €100 in 2019. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] In China LFP batteries are popular and are cheaper. [ 61 ] Total cost of ownership [ edit ] In the EU and US, the total cost of ownership of recent electric cars is cheaper than that of equivalent gasoline cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 62 ] A 2024 Consumer Reports analysis of 29 car brands found Tesla was the least expensive to maintain over a 10-year period; Tesla was the only all-electric brand included. [ 63 ] The greater the distance driven per year, the more likely the total cost of ownership for an electric car will be less than for an equivalent ICE car. [ 64 ] The break-even distance varies by country depending on the taxes, subsidies, and different costs of energy.  In some countries the comparison may vary by city, as a type of car may have different charges to enter different cities; for example, in England, London charges ICE cars more than Birmingham does. [ 65 ] Purchase cost [ edit ] Several national and local governments have established EV incentives to reduce the purchase price of electric cars and other plug-ins. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] As of 2020 [update] , the electric vehicle battery is more than a quarter of the total cost of the car. [ 70 ] New purchase prices are expected to drop below those of new ICE cars when battery costs fall below US$100 per kWh, which is forecast to be in the mid-2020s. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Leasing or subscriptions are popular in some countries, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] depending somewhat on national taxes and subsidies, [ 75 ] and end of lease cars are expanding the second hand market. [ 76 ] Running costs [ edit ] Electricity almost always costs less than gasoline per kilometer travelled, but the price of electricity often varies depending on where and what time of day the car is charged. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Cost savings are also affected by the price of gasoline which can vary by location. [ 79 ] Environmental aspects [ edit ] The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is one of the largest known lithium reserves in the world. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Main article: Environmental aspects of the electric car Electric cars have several benefits when replacing ICE cars, including a significant reduction of local air pollution, as they do not emit exhaust pollutants such as volatile organic compounds , hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide , ozone , lead , and various oxides of nitrogen . [ 82 ] Similar to ICE vehicles, electric cars emit particulates from tyre and brake wear [ 83 ] which may damage health, [ 84 ] although regenerative braking in electric cars means less brake dust. [ 85 ] More research is needed on non-exhaust particulates. [ 86 ] The sourcing of fossil fuels (oil well to gasoline tank) causes further damage as well as use of resources during the extraction and refinement processes. Depending on the production process and the source of the electricity to charge the vehicle, emissions may be partly shifted from cities to the plants that generate electricity and produce the car as well as to the transportation of material. [ 43 ] The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emissions of the electricity source and the efficiency of the vehicle. For electricity from the grid , the life-cycle emissions vary depending on the proportion of coal-fired power , but are always less than ICE cars. [ 87 ] The cost of installing charging infrastructure has been estimated to be repaid by health cost savings in less than three years. [ 88 ] According to a 2020 study, balancing lithium supply and demand for the rest of the century will require good recycling systems, vehicle-to-grid integration, and lower lithium intensity of transportation. [ 89 ] The adoption of electric cars has accelerated due to advancements in battery technology, environmental concerns, and supportive government policies, making them a key player in the transition to cleaner transportation options. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Some activists and journalists have raised concerns over the perceived lack of impact of electric cars in solving the climate change crisis [ 92 ] compared to other, less popularized methods. [ 93 ] These concerns have largely centered around the existence of less carbon-intensive and more efficient forms of transportation such as active mobility , [ 94 ] mass transit and e-scooters and the continuation of a system designed for cars first. [ 95 ] Public opinion [ edit ] A 2022 climate survey highlighting European, American, and Chinese car buying preferences. [ 96 ] A 2022 survey found that 33% of car buyers in Europe will opt for a petrol or diesel car when purchasing a new vehicle. 67% of the respondents mentioned opting for the hybrid or electric version. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] More specifically, it found that electric cars are only preferred by 28% of Europeans, making them the least preferred type of vehicle. 39% of Europeans tend to prefer hybrid vehicles , while 33% prefer petrol or diesel vehicles . [ 97 ] [ 99 ] 44% Chinese car buyers, on the other hand, are the most likely to buy an electric car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car. [ 97 ] [ 100 ] Specifically for the EU , 47% of car buyers over 65 years old are likely to purchase a hybrid vehicle, while 31% of younger respondents do not consider hybrid vehicles a good option. 35% would rather opt for a petrol or diesel vehicle, and 24% for an electric car instead of a hybrid. [ 97 ] [ 101 ] In the EU, only 13% of the total population do not plan on owning a vehicle at all. [ 97 ] Performance [ edit ] Acceleration and drivetrain design [ edit ] Typical ""skateboard"" layout with the battery as floor and a motor at one or both axles Electric motors can provide high power-to-weight ratios . Batteries can be designed to supply the electrical current needed to support these motors. Electric motors have a flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, most electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch. Many electric cars have faster acceleration than average ICE cars, largely due to reduced drivetrain frictional losses and the more quickly-available torque of an electric motor. [ 102 ] However, NEVs may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. Electric vehicles can also use a motor in each wheel hub or next to the wheels; this is rare but claimed to be safer. [ 103 ] Electric vehicles that lack an axle , differential , or transmission can have less drivetrain inertia. Some direct current motor -equipped drag racer EVs have simple two-speed manual transmissions to improve top speed. [ 104 ] The concept electric supercar Rimac Concept One claims it can go from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.5 seconds. Tesla claims the upcoming Tesla Roadster will go 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds. [ 105 ] Energy efficiency [ edit ] Main article: Electric car energy efficiency Energy efficiency of electric cars in towns and on motorways according to the DoE Internal combustion engines have thermodynamic limits on efficiency, expressed as a fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. Gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories; diesel engines can reach on-board efficiency of 20%; electric vehicles convert over 77% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] This is partially offset by power required to move the significant weight of the batteries. Electric motors are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. However, they are not equally efficient at all speeds. To allow for this, some cars with dual electric motors have one electric motor with a gear optimised for city speeds and the second electric motor with a gear optimised for highway speeds. The electronics select the motor that has the best efficiency for the current speed and acceleration. [ 109 ] Regenerative braking , which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking. [ 43 ] [ 107 ] Cabin heating and cooling [ edit ] Combustion powered cars harness waste heat from the engine to provide cabin heating, but this option is not available in an electric vehicle. While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible heat pump , such as on the Nissan Leaf. [ 110 ] PTC junction cooling [ 111 ] is also attractive for its simplicity—this kind of system is used, for example, in the 2008 Tesla Roadster. To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Renault Zoe and Tesla cars can be preheated while the vehicle is plugged in. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Some electric cars (for example, the Citroën Berlingo Electrique ) use an auxiliary heating system (for example gasoline -fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice ""green"" and ""Zero emissions"" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with solar power external batteries and USB fans or coolers, or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked; two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option. [ 115 ] Safety [ edit ] Side impact test of a Tesla Model X The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard ISO 6469. This document is divided into three parts dealing with specific issues: On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery [ 116 ] Functional safety means and protection against failures [ 117 ] Protection of persons against electrical hazards [ 118 ] Research published in the British Medical Journal in 2024 indicates that between 2013 and 2017 in the United Kingdom, electric cars killed pedestrians at twice the rate of petrol or diesel vehicles because ""they are less audible to pedestrians in urban areas"". [ 119 ] Jurisdictions have passed laws requiring electric vehicles to be manufactured with sound generators. [ 119 ] Weight [ edit ] The weight of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV far heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle. In a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits to the occupant, while increasing harm to others. [ 120 ] On average, an accident will cause about 50% more injuries to the occupants of a 2,000 lb (900 kg) vehicle than those in a 3,000 lb (1,400 kg) vehicle. [ 121 ] Heavier cars are more dangerous to people outside the car if they hit a pedestrian or another vehicle. [ 122 ] Stability [ edit ] The battery in skateboard configuration lowers the center of gravity, increasing driving stability, lowering the risk of an accident through loss of control. [ 123 ] Additionally, a lower center of gravity provides a greater resistance to roll-over crashes. [ 124 ] If there is a separate motor near or in each wheel, this is claimed to be safer due to better handling. [ 125 ] Risk of fire [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents Like their ICE counterparts, electric vehicle batteries can catch fire after a crash or mechanical failure. [ 126 ] Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents have occurred, albeit fewer per distance traveled than ICE vehicles. [ 127 ] Some cars' high-voltage systems are designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, [ 128 ] [ 129 ] and in case of failure firefighters may be trained for manual high-voltage system shutdown. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Much more water may be required than for ICE car fires and a thermal imaging camera is recommended to warn of possible re-ignition of battery fires. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Controls [ edit ] As of 2018 [update] , most electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional automatic transmission . Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear, and no parking pawl may be present, the modes ""P"" and ""N"" are often still provided on the selector. In this case, the motor is disabled in ""N"" and an electrically actuated hand brake provides the ""P"" mode. In some cars, the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in ""D"", similar to a traditional automatic transmission car. [ 134 ] When an internal combustion vehicle's accelerator is released, it may slow by engine braking , depending on the type of transmission and mode. EVs are usually equipped with regenerative braking that slows the vehicle and recharges the battery somewhat. [ 135 ] Regenerative braking systems also decrease the use of the conventional brakes (similar to engine braking in an ICE vehicle), reducing brake wear and maintenance costs. Batteries [ edit ] Nissan Leaf battery pack Main article: Electric vehicle battery Lithium-ion-based batteries are often used for their high power and energy density. [ 136 ] Batteries with different chemical compositions are becoming more widely used, such as lithium iron phosphate which is not dependent on nickel and cobalt so can be used to make cheaper batteries and thus cheaper cars. [ 137 ] Range [ edit ] Further information: List of electric cars currently available Comparison of EPA -rated range for model year 2020 electric cars rated up until January 2020 [ 138 ] The range of an electric car depends on the number and type of batteries used, and (as with all vehicles), the aerodynamics, weight and type of vehicle, performance requirements, and the weather. [ 139 ] Cars marketed for mainly city use are often manufactured with a short range battery to keep them small and light. [ 140 ] Most electric cars are fitted with a display of the expected range. This may take into account how the vehicle is being used and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some roadside assistance organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency. [ 141 ] Charging [ edit ] Connectors [ edit ] Main article: IEC 62196 Most electric cars use a wired connection to supply electricity for recharging. Electric vehicle charging plugs are not universal throughout the world. However vehicles using one type of plug are generally able to charge at other types of charging stations through the use of plug adapters. [ 142 ] The Type 2 connector is the most common type of plug, but different versions are used in China and Europe. [ 143 ] [ 144 ] The Type 1 (also called SAE J1772) connector is common in North America [ 145 ] [ 146 ] but rare elsewhere, as it does not support three-phase charging. [ 147 ] Wireless charging , either for stationary cars or as an electric road , [ 148 ] is less common as of 2021 [update] , but is used in some cities for taxis. [ 149 ] [ 150 ] Home charging [ edit ] Electric cars are usually charged overnight from a home charging station ;  sometimes known as a charging point, wallbox charger, or simply a charger; in a garage or on the outside of a house. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] As of 2021 [update] typical home chargers are 7 kW, but not all include smart charging . [ 151 ] Compared to fossil fuel vehicles, the need for charging using public infrastructure is diminished because of the opportunities for home charging; vehicles can be plugged in and begin each day with a full charge. [ 153 ] Charging from a standard outlet is also possible but very slow. Public charging [ edit ] Charging station at Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . This station is run by Petrobras and uses solar energy . Main article: Electric vehicle charging network Public charging stations are almost always faster than home chargers, [ 154 ] with many supplying direct current to avoid the bottleneck of going through the car's AC to DC converter, [ 155 ] as of 2021 [update] the fastest being 350 kW. [ 156 ] Combined Charging System (CCS) is the most widespread charging standard, [ 144 ] whereas the GB/T 27930 standard is used in China, and CHAdeMO in Japan. The United States has no de facto standard, with a mix of CCS, Tesla Superchargers , and CHAdeMO charging stations. Charging an electric vehicle using public charging stations takes longer than refueling a fossil fuel vehicle. The speed at which a vehicle can recharge depends on the charging station's charging speed and the vehicle's own capacity to receive a charge.  As of 2021 [update] some cars are 400-volt and some 800-volt. [ 157 ] Connecting a vehicle that can accommodate very fast charging to a charging station with a very high rate of charge can refill the vehicle's battery to 80% in 15 to 20 minutes. [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Vehicles and charging stations with slower charging speeds may take as long as two hours to refill a battery to 80%. As with a mobile phone, the final 20% takes longer because the systems slow down to fill the battery safely and avoid damaging it. [ citation needed ] A battery swapping station operated by Nio Some companies are building battery swapping stations, to substantially reduce the effective time to recharge. [ 160 ] [ 161 ] Some electric cars (for example, the BMW i3 ) have an optional gasoline range extender . The system is intended as an emergency backup to extend range to the next recharging location, and not for long-distance travel. [ 162 ] Electric roads [ edit ] Main article: Electric road Three types of electric road systems. An electric bus (black) receives power from the road: (A) with three inductive pickups (red) from a strip of resonant inductive coils (blue) embedded several centimeters under the road (gray); (B) with a current collector (red) sliding over a ground-level power supply rail segment (blue)  flush with the surface of the road (gray); (C) with an overhead current collector (red) sliding against a powered overhead line (blue) An electric road system (ERS) is a road which supplies electric power to vehicles travelling on it. Common implementations are overhead power lines above the road, ground-level power supply through conductive rails, and dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) through resonant inductive coils or inductive rails embedded in the road. Overhead power lines are limited to commercial vehicles while ground-level rails and inductive power transfer can be used by any vehicle, which allows for public charging through a power metering and billing systems. Of the three methods, ground-level conductive rails are estimated to be the most cost-effective. [ 163 ] : 10–11 National electric road projects [ edit ] Government studies and trials have been conducted in several countries seeking a national electric road network. Korea was the first to implement an induction-based public electric road with a commercial bus line in 2013 after testing an experimental shuttle service in 2009, [ 164 ] : 11–18 but it was shut down due to aging infrastructure amidst controversy over the continued public funding of the technology. [ 165 ] United Kingdom municipal projects in 2015 [ 166 ] and 2021 found wireless electric roads financially unfeasible. [ 167 ] Sweden has been performing assessments of various electric road technologies since 2013 under the Swedish Transport Administration electric road program . [ 168 ] : 5 After receiving electric road construction offers in excess of the project's budget in 2023, Sweden pursued cost-reduction measures for either wireless or rail electric roads. [ 169 ] The project's final report was published in 2024, which recommended against funding a national electric road network in Sweden as it would not be cost-effective, unless the technology was adopted by its trading partners such as by France and Germany. [ 170 ] [ 171 ] Germany found in 2023 that the wireless electric road system (wERS) by Electreon collects 64.3% of the transmitted energy, poses many difficulties during installation, and blocks access to other infrastructure in the road. [ 172 ] Germany trialed overhead lines in three projects and reported they are too expensive, difficult to maintain, and pose a safety risk. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] [ 175 ] France found similar drawbacks for overhead lines as Germany did. France began several electric road pilot projects in 2023 for inductive and rail systems. [ 176 ] Ground-level power supply systems are considered the most likely candidates. [ 177 ] Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering [ edit ] Main article: Vehicle-to-grid During peak load periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capabilities could contribute energy to the grid. These vehicles can then be recharged during off-peak hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. The batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power. [ 178 ] Lifespan [ edit ] Main article: Rechargeable battery § Lifespan and cycle stability As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently charged to 100%; however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable. [ 179 ] A typical warranty is 8 years or 100,000 mi (160,000 km), [ 180 ] but for non-professional drivers mileage may not be relevant, and the batteries usually last much longer, [ 181 ] perhaps 15 to 20 years in the car and then more years in another use. [ 182 ] Currently available electric cars [ edit ] Share of new cars sold that are battery-electric and plug-in hybrid, 2010 to 2023 for selected countries. Sales of electric cars [ edit ] Main article: List of production battery electric vehicles Tesla became the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer in December 2019. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Its Model S was the world's top selling plug-in electric car in 2015 and 2016, [ 185 ] [ 186 ] its Model 3 has been the world's best selling plug-in electric car for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021, and the Model Y was the top selling plug-in car in 2022. [ 187 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] The Tesla Model 3 surpassed the Leaf in early 2020 to become the world's cumulative best selling electric car. [ 19 ] Tesla produced its 1 millionth electric car in March 2020, becoming the first auto manufacturer to do so, [ 192 ] and in June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass 1 million sales. [ 20 ] Tesla has been listed as the world's top selling plug-in electric car manufacturer, both as a brand and by automotive group for four years running, from 2018 to 2021. [ 188 ] [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] [ 189 ] At the end of 2021, Tesla's global cumulative sales since 2012 totaled 2.3 million units, [ 196 ] with 936,222 of those delivered in 2021. [ 197 ] BYD Auto is another leading electric vehicle manufacturer, with the majority of its sales coming from China. From 2018 to 2023, BYD produced nearly 3.18 million purely plug-in electric car, with 1,574,822 of those were produced in 2023 alone. [ 198 ] In the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD surpassed Tesla as the top-selling electric vehicle manufacturer by selling 526,409 battery electric cars, while Tesla delivered 484,507 vehicles. [ 199 ] [ 200 ] As of December 2021 [update] , the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance listed as one of major all-electric vehicle manufacturers, with global all-electric vehicle sales totaling over 1 million light-duty electric vehicles, including those manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors since 2009. [ 201 ] [ 202 ] Nissan leads global sales within the Alliance, with 1 million cars and vans sold by July 2023, [ 203 ] followed by the Groupe Renault with more than 397,000 electric vehicles sold worldwide through December 2020, including its Twizy heavy quadricycle . [ 204 ] As of July 2023 [update] , global sales totaled over 650,000 units since inception. [ 203 ] Other leading electric vehicles manufacturers are GAC Aion (part of GAC Group , with 962,385 cumulative sales as of December 2023 [update] ), [ 205 ] SAIC Motor with 1,838,000 units (as of July 2023 [update] ), Geely , and Volkswagen .

Electric cars by country [ edit ] Main article: electric car use by country In the year of 2021, the total number of electric cars on the world's roads went to about 16.5 million. The sales of electric cars in the first quarter of 2022 went up to 2 million. [ 253 ] China has the largest all-electric car fleet in use, with 2.58 million at the end of 2019, more than half (53.9%) of the world's electric car stock. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids since 2012. [ 254 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 255 ] Annual sales of plug-in electric passenger cars in the world's top markets between 2011 and 2023 [ 256 ] [ 257 ] [ 258 ] [ 259 ] [ 260 ] [ 261 ] [ 262 ] [ 263 ] [ 264 ] Evolution of the ratio between global sales of BEVs and PHEVs between 2011 and 2024 [ 254 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] [ 265 ] [ 266 ] [ 255 ] [ 267 ] Government policies and incentives [ edit ] A dedicated electric car free charging and parking lot in Oslo Main article: Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles See also: Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles Four out of ten Europeans interviewed for the European Investment Bank climate survey thought subsidies for electric cars should be a priority to fight climate change. Several national, provincial, and local governments around the world have introduced policies to support the mass-market adoption of plug-in electric vehicles . A variety of policies have been established to provide: financial support to consumers and manufacturers; non-monetary incentives; subsidies for the deployment of charging infrastructure; electric vehicle charging stations in buildings; and long-term regulations with specific targets. [ 257 ] [ 268 ] [ 269 ] Timeline of national targets for full ICE phase out or 100% ZEV car sales [ 257 ] [ 270 ] Selected countries Year Norway (100% ZEV sales) 2025 Denmark 2030 Iceland Ireland Netherlands (100% ZEV sales) Sweden United Kingdom (100% ZEV sales) 2035 France 2040 Canada (100% ZEV sales) Singapore Germany (100% ZEV sales) 2050 U.S. (10 ZEV states) Japan (100% HEV/PHEV/ZEV sales) Financial incentives for consumers are aiming to make electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars due to the higher upfront cost of electric vehicles. Depending on battery size, there are one-time purchase incentives such as grants and tax credits ; exemptions from import duties; exemptions from road tolls and congestion charges ; and exemption of registration and annual fees. Among the non-monetary incentives, there are several perks such allowing plug-in vehicles access to bus lanes and high-occupancy vehicle lanes , free parking and free charging. [ 268 ] Some countries or cities that restrict private car ownership (for example, a purchase quota system for new vehicles), or have implemented permanent driving restrictions (for example, no-drive days), have these schemes exclude electric vehicles to promote their adoption. [ 271 ] [ 272 ] [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] Several countries, including England and India, are introducing regulations that require electric vehicle charging stations in certain buildings. [ 269 ] [ 277 ] [ 278 ] Some government have also established long term regulatory signals with specific targets such as zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates, national or regional CO 2 emission regulations, stringent fuel economy standards, and the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicle sales. [ 257 ] [ 268 ] For example, Norway set a national goal that by 2025 all new car sales should be ZEVs ( battery electric or hydrogen ). [ 279 ] [ 280 ] While these incentives aim to facilitate a quicker transition from internal combustion cars, they have been criticized by some economists for creating excess deadweight loss in the electric car market, which may partially counteract environmental gains.

( August 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant traction as an integral component of the global automotive landscape in recent years. Major automakers from around the world have adopted EVs as a critical component of their strategic plans, indicating a paradigm shift toward sustainable transportation. As of Manufacturer Investment Investment Timeframe # EVs Year Goal Notes 2020-11 Volkswagen $86 billion 2025 27 2022 Plans 27 electric vehicles by 2022, on a dedicated EV platform dubbed "" Modular Electric Toolkit "" and initialed as MEB. [ 284 ] In November 2020 it announced the intention to invest $86 billion in the following five years, aimed at developing EVs and increasing its share in the EV market. Total capital expenditure will include ""digital factories"", automotive software and self-driving cars. [ 285 ] 2020-11 GM $27 billion 30 2035 [ 286 ] Announced that it is boosting its EV and self-driving investment from $20 billion to $27 billion, and it currently plans to have 30 EVs on the market by the end of 2025 (including: the Hummer EV ; the Cadillac Lyriq SUV; Buick, GMC, and Chevrolet EVs; and a Chevy compact crossover EV). [ 287 ] CEO Barra said 40% of the vehicles GM will offer in the United States will be battery electric vehicles by the end of 2025. [ 288 ] GM's ""BEV3"" next-generation electric vehicle platform is designed to be flexible for use in many different vehicle types, such as front, rear and all-wheel drive configurations. [ 289 ] 2019-01 Mercedes $23 billion 2030 10 2022 Plans to increase their electric car manufacturing to 50% in global sales by 2030. [ 290 ] 2019-07 Ford $29 billion [ 291 ] 2025 Will use Volkswagen's Modular Electric Toolkit (""MEB"") to design and build its own fully electric vehicles starting in 2023. [ 292 ] The Ford Mustang Mach-E is an electric crossover that will reach up to 480 km (300 miles). [ 293 ] Ford is planning to release an electric F-150 in the 2021 time frame. [ 294 ] [ 295 ] 2019-03 BMW 12 2025 Plans 12 all electric vehicles by 2025, using a fifth-generation electric powertrain architecture, which will save weight and cost and increase capacity. [ 296 ] BMW has ordered €10 billion worth of battery cells for the period from 2021 through 2030. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] [ 299 ] 2020-01 Hyundai 23 2025 Announced that it plans 23 pure electric cars by 2025. [ 300 ] Hyundai will announce its next generation electric vehicle platform, named e-GMP, in 2021. [ 301 ] 2019-06 Toyota Has developed a global EV platform named e-TNGA that can accommodate a three-row SUV, sporty sedan, small crossover or a boxy compact. [ 302 ] Toyota and Subaru will release a new EV on a shared platform; [ 303 ] it will be about the size of a Toyota RAV4 or a Subaru Forester. 2019-04 29 automakers $300 billion 2029 A Reuters analysis of 29 global automakers concluded that automakers are planning on spending $300 billion over the next 5 to 10 years on electric cars, with 45% of that investment projected to occur in China. [ 304 ] 2020-10 Fiat Launched its new electric version of the New 500 for sale in Europe starting in early 2021. [ 305 ] [ 306 ] 2020-11 Nissan Announced the intention to sell only electric and hybrid cars in China from 2025, introducing nine new models. Nissan other plans includes manufacturing, by 2035, half zero-emission vehicles and half gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. [ 307 ] In 2018 Infiniti , the luxury brand of Nissan, announced that by 2021 all newly introduced vehicles will be electric or hybrid. [ 308 ] 2020-12 Audi €35 billion 2021–2025 20 2025 30 new electrified models by 2025, of which 20 PEV. [ 309 ] By 2030–2035, Audi intends to offer just electric vehicles. [ 310 ] Forecasts [ edit ] Total global EV sales in 2030 were predicted to reach 31.1 million by Deloitte . [ 311 ] The International Energy Agency predicted that the total global stock of EVs would reach almost 145 million by 2030 under current policies, or 230 million if Sustainable Development policies were adopted. [ 312 ] As of 2024, there are approximately 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity, representing 83% of the world's unelectrified population. [ 313 ] The World Bank Group and the African Development Bank plan to provide access to electricity to 300 million people in that region by 2030. [ 313 ] At this time, there are just over 20,000 electric vehicles and less than 1,000 charging stations in Africa. [ 314 ] However, EV manufacturers have already built or are planning to build production plants in 21 African countries.

Main Menu Sign Up Sign Up EV Fleets Pro Course Lesson 1: Understanding electric vehicles Reading electric vehicle specs: power output and battery size Reading electric vehicle specs: power output and battery size If you’ve started to look into EVs for your fleet, you may be encountering some new terms that describe electric vehicle battery size, power output and efficiency. Here we simplify some of the specifications that might be new to you, and match them up with their equivalents in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. EV power (kW, not horsepower) EV efficiency (kWh or Le per 100km, not litres) Electric vehicle battery size (kWh, not litres) Side by side: the Ford F-150 ICE and EV EV power (kW, not horsepower) As you read about EVs, you will see kW, or kilowatts, in addition to horsepower. Both mean the same thing: power output. The term horsepower comes from back when car builders were trying to explain engines to people who still got around with actual horses. In an EV, kilowatts keep the measurement for motor output, battery size and charging rates all on the same terms. That said, like those stagecoach drivers from a century ago, not all EV buyers are comfortable working with kW just yet, so automakers will often still list horsepower figures. A quick conversion gets you to whichever figure you need. An integrated electric vehicle drive module with single-speed transmission, in cutaway. kW For electric vehicles, kW represents the amount of power that the drivetrain can deliver to the wheels to propel the vehicle. Torque is still expressed in the same terms: Newton-metres (Nm) in metric, or pound-feet (lb-ft) in imperial measurements. In Canada, we typically use lb-ft. EV efficiency (kWh or Le per 100km, not litres) Kilowatt-hour (kWh) A kilowatt-hour is a way to measure energy: It’s the amount of electricity required to power one 1,000-watt appliance for one hour, or 1,000 one-watt appliances for one hour. In electric vehicles kWh is used to show how much energy a battery can store, and how much energy is required to propel the vehicle for 100 km (kWh/100 km). You’re probably used to working with fuel consumption in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km). With EVs, two different measurements can be used. One is litres-equivalent per 100 kilometres, or Le/100 km. Natural Resources Canada uses this to express an EV’s energy use in the same terms as a combustion vehicle, with a conversion of 8.9 kWh as the energy equivalent of one litre of gasoline. 1 This is useful for understanding EV energy use relative to a combustion counterpart, but it doesn’t help with calculating costs. To do that, you’ll want to use the other measurement, which is kWh/100 km. This tells you how many kilowatt-hours of power an EV will use to travel 100 kilometres. Once you know how much you’re paying per kWh for energy, this measurement is just as useful to you as L/100 km. It’s the one you’ll refer to most often when working on your budgets. Electric vehicle battery size (kWh, not litres) Electric vehicle battery size is expressed in terms of how much power the battery will hold, just like the litres in a fuel tank. The vehicle’s stated range is obtained by dividing the battery capacity by the efficiency rating. The bigger the battery (131 kWh for the Ford F-150 Lightning extended range), the further an EV can go (515 km, versus 368 km for the standard range 98 kWh battery pack) on a single charge. However, just like in a combustion vehicle, there’s more to this: driving style, outside temperature, road conditions, towing and payload demands, and more can affect real-world range. But this figure is a good baseline for comparing range between EVs with similar specifications.

Nov 8 Written By EV Connect As electric cars and other electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, many consumers hoping to make the switch want to know: How long does an EV battery last? While battery life span varies by manufacturer and age, in general you can expect new batteries to rival and often exceed the longevity of drivetrain components on internal combustion engine (ICE) Vehicles. EV Batteries: The Basics Electric cars are powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are more energy dense than the lead-acid batteries found in internal combustion engines or rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries found in some hybrids. A lithium-ion battery’s high energy density means it produces more power for its size, making it ideal for an electric car. Because EVs are powered by the battery alone, they are far more simple and efficient than ICE vehicles. As lithium-ion batteries have decreased in cost by 97% over the last 30 years , experts believe that EVs will soon be as cheap to produce as ICE vehicles. How Do EV Batteries Degrade? EV batteries typically degrade due to temperature, cycles and time . Storage and operating temperatures have a huge impact on EV battery longevity; in general, warmer climates negatively affect the lifespan of an EV battery. As the battery goes through charge cycles — discharged while driving and charged back up while plugged in — it slowly loses maximum potential. However, simply not using or charging your EV battery does not mean it will last forever: Calendar degradation is the battery losing life over time. Recent findings from Stanford's two-year study of 92 lithium-ion batteries have shown that real-world driving conditions, such as stop-and-go traffic and rest periods, actually allow batteries to degrade more slowly compared to traditional laboratory testing methods. The research revealed that batteries perform better than expected during sharp, short accelerations, contrary to previous assumptions about degradation. Unlike the lithium-ion batteries found in a phone or laptop, EV batteries utilize complex battery management systems (BMS) that regulate how the batteries are charged and discharged to prolong their life . That means your EV battery is most likely to experience temperature or calendar degradation. How Long Does an Electric Car Battery Last? So the question remains: How long can you expect your EV battery to last? Fortunately for consumers, the government mandates EV manufacturers to warranty batteries for 8 years or 100,000 miles , while California extends that warranty to 10 years or 150,000 miles. As EV battery packs become cheaper to manufacture, companies can create larger batteries with more energy potential, which in turn increases their mile-range. Additionally, the improved technology reduces the degradation of batteries, meaning that over time the maximum potential stays closer to the new battery. These improvements, combined with the Stanford study's findings about real-world performance, suggest that EV manufacturers could optimize their battery management software to further extend battery longevity based on actual usage patterns. The Stanford research distinguishes between degradation caused by repeated charge-discharge cycles, which primarily affects commercial EV fleets, and degradation due to natural aging over time, which is more relevant for private EV owners using their vehicles mainly for commuting. Because newer batteries already have greatly increased in mileage range, as they degrade they will still maintain a longer mileage range than batteries from just a few years ago. Finally, because lithium-ion batteries are made up of many individual cells, you rarely need to replace the entire battery as it degrades. Instead, you can save money by simply replacing dead cells. How Does EV Battery Longevity Compare to ICE Vehicles? Both of the mandated warranty numbers (8 years, 100,000 miles) for EV batteries far exceed the average ICE vehicle drivetrain warranty of 5 years or 60,000 miles. The average lifetime mileage of an ICE vehicle is about 133,000 miles . On average, EV batteries only degrade at a rate of 2.3% of maximum capacity per year , and recent Stanford research suggests that EV batteries may last up to 40% longer than previously thought. This means the average EV battery could potentially last around 280,000 miles or more , more than double the lifespan of a typical ICE vehicle. This significant increase in expected longevity makes the value proposition of EVs even more compelling. And the future looks even brighter: some manufacturers are already promising even greater mileage capabilities, with Tesla setting their sights on a million-mile battery and claiming they are not far from achieving this goal. How To Extend EV Battery Life While EV batteries are already durable, there are specific actions owners can take to further maximize battery lifespan. Follow EV Manufacturer Guidelines First, it is important to follow your EV’s specific guidelines for optimal battery performance, as well as keep your vehicle’s software up to date. Because each EV manufacturer utilizes different battery chemistries and cooling technologies, each will have its own set of optimal operating and charging instructions . Maintain Moderate Temperatures EVs with liquid-cooled batteries see better battery life retention because they maintain lower operating temperatures. In general, storing and operating your EV in moderate climates is an effective way to extend battery life. Even if you live in a warmer climate, parking your vehicle in a garage or well-shaded area helps, as a vehicle spends most of its life parked. Minimize Rapid Charging While occasionally utilizing direct current rapid charging (DCRC) to power your vehicle is okay, if you can minimize the frequency of this charging method, you are likely to see less battery degradation later in its life. Luckily, EV Connect offers a variety of charging stations to ensure a number of efficient solutions for your vehicle. And remember: Don’t be afraid to use your EV, as frequent use is not a major factor in battery degradation. An EV Battery’s Second Life One of the most exciting aspects of EV battery degradation for eco-conscious consumers is the fact that batteries can still serve a sustainable purpose after they leave your EV. Even as they lose efficiency to power a car (usually at 70% of their maximum charge potential ), these powerful EV batteries retain enough life to pair with solar and can serve as secondary energy for your home. Some manufacturers even collect or buy back used batteries to sustainably power other projects, such as sports arenas. You can feel secure in knowing that the sustainability of your EV’s power continues long after it leaves your vehicle. EV batteries continue to decrease in cost, travel more miles on a charge and retain longer life spans. Experts already suggest that EV batteries will exceed the longevity of ICE components, and the technology improves every year. It’s all good news: Your EV battery will serve your needs for years to come, and it can even be sustainably recycled after its life from powering your vehicle. Interested in EV charging stations?

There’s nothing quite like the feeling you get when taking a top-down cruise in a convertible. From back-country trails in a rugged model to paved streets in a sleek sporty style, there are so many ways to enjoy the rush of driving a convertible. If you’re considering buying a convertible, take a look below for our wide range of soft-top and hardtop convertibles. You’ll find plenty of new and used cars in your area that will let you take the top down and enjoy the sunshine. Size and style Convertibles range in size from small two-seat sports cars to compact or mid-size vehicles that offer 2+2 seating. Trunk space varies from fairly large to practically non-existent, and backseat leg-room can be very tight. You can also choose between soft-top and hideaway hardtop designs. Both top styles have advantages and disadvantages. For instance, a soft-top convertible does not provide much insulation from colder weather. Space and storage When buying a new convertible, consider your space and storage needs. If storage is important for you, a large trunk is essential. Remember that a convertible top has to go somewhere when it is retracted, and that can take up a good portion of the trunk area. A soft-top will generally use up less storage space than a retractable hardtop. Here are some top tips to consider when buying a convertible. Top tips: Determine your budget. Convertible prices vary greatly, so you should be able to find an open-air cruiser that suits your needs Check the Natural Resources Canada fuel consumption guide ",Y,N,N

Diesel cars can give you up to 30 percent better fuel economy than gasoline-fueled cars, which means significant savings. Diesel may help cut down on maintenance All vehicles require a maintenance schedule to keep them running at optimum performance, but diesel vehicles may require less maintenance. This doesn’t mean they require no maintenance, just less, and any maintenance that is applied is worth the investment. For example, with diesel engines, there is no need for ignition tune-ups because they run on compression ignition instead of spark plug technology. Having less maintenance provides even further savings besides fuel costs. Their engine setup makes diesel cars more durable Diesel engines have to operate at higher temperatures and have been engineered to do this. This engineering includes higher quality material use and craftsmanship, which makes the technology last longer than the usual gasoline-fueled products. You get more power and torque from a diesel engine A diesel engine produces more energy than a gasoline-fueled one, resulting in more torque. Torque is especially important if you are going to be using your vehicle for towing because a higher level of torque means higher towing capacity. A diesel vehicle has better resale value Even if the body of the car isn’t in the best shape, the durability and performance of the engine will still make it desirable for another purchaser.

The average American drives 37 miles per day . Most charging can be done at home or while you’re at work. Think first and foremost about your daily commute and secondarily how often you travel long distances. According to a recent Bloomberg survey , two thirds of respondents indicated that 300-plus miles of range was enough for their needs. For the times you take a road trip, you will want to plan your roadside charging along the way. Generally, high speed charging is available on main corridors across the country, usually near restaurants or shopping. This will get you an 80% charge in about 30 minutes. Consider also how long you need to drive in cold weather. Much like the loss of energy efficiency of gasoline-powered vehicles, EV battery range can drop significantly in cold weather . However, a 2025 report found that electric vehicles remain fully functional in extreme cold, with even the worst-performing models still retaining over 60% of their range and quickly regaining power with a short charge. The best performing models only lost 14% of their range. Keep in mind you’ll have more range with stop and go driving than out on the open highway, due to the fact that the act of braking regenerates the battery. On the highway, it’s possible to increase your range significantly – even above the EPA rated range – by slowing your speed to around 60 mph. You’ll get very familiar with your EV’s range once you test it out at different speeds and under different terrains and weather conditions. EV Charging and Range FAQs How Far Can I Drive Before I Need To Charge the Battery? How far an EV can go before it needs to be charged depends on an electric vehicle’s make and model, the current amount of charge and driving conditions. Read our tips below for getting more range out of an EV’s battery. How Can I Find EV Charging Stations? Most EV drivers charge at home overnight if/when needed, waking up to a fully charged EV. If you live in an apartment or don’t have off-street parking, you may be able to charge for free at your workplace or other free public chargers. If you do plan to take longer trips, just a little planning will ensure you can find charging stations along the way. Fast charging “level 3” stations (usually located near markets and restaurants) already enable charging up to 80% full in about 30 minutes, making EV road trips with fueling stops/meal breaks easy. Battery technology is quickly improving too – faster ways to charge your EV are currently being developed. Also, keep in mind that there are many free places to charge your EV , as well as ways you can keep your EV going during power shutoffs . How Can I Charge My EV at Home? EVs can charge anywhere there is a normal 120v outlet – no more going to the gas station. EVs come with a plug that will work in a regular electric outlet, and add about 40 miles of range overnight. However, you also might want to consider a level 2 EV charger at your home – this is typically a 240v outlet like the one many people have for their electric clothes dryer. This charger gives about 25 to 40 miles of range per hour. Many EV drivers use a home level 2 charger to top up to a full charge overnight. About 1/3 of electric car drivers have rooftop solar, so their electricity is coming from sunshine – saving fuel costs as well as the environment.

Home Stories Journey to net zero stories 15th July 2022 Journey to net zero While electric vehicles are recognised as reducing carbon emissions – especially when powered by renewable energy – we still get lots of questions about the life of electric car batteries and whether they will end up in landfill, potentially knocking electric cars’ green credentials. Here we answer those concerns. Electric vehicles (EVs) aren’t the future any more, they’re the present. The transition to EVs has been accelerated on both sides of the Atlantic, with a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the UK by 2030 1 , and a goal set for half of all new vehicle sales in the US to be electric by 2030 2 . 'Range anxiety' has been recognised as a concern for potential EV drivers, with £950m ($1.16bn) of UK government funding now earmarked for rapid charging at service stations and £1.3bn ($1.59bn) for EV charging infrastructure, including homes and streets. Similarly, the US has declared that there will be 500,000 EV charging stations nationwide by 2030. The White House has introduced a plan to distribute $5 billion (£4,091,000,000) to states across the nation 3 , which should help to eliminate range anxiety amongst drivers. That leaves one remaining issue for would-be electric car buyers – what happens to electric car batteries at the end of their working life? How do electric car batteries work? While internal combustion engines get their energy from burning petrol or diesel, an electric vehicle is powered directly from a big pack of batteries. These EV batteries are worlds apart from the heavy lead-acid batteries in conventional combustion engine cars. EV batteries are much closer to the ones in your mobile phone or laptop, yet more reliable and with a vastly increased life span. EV batteries use a pack consisting of 2,000-plus individual lithium-ion cells working together. There’s no lithium metal in the batteries, only ions – atoms or molecules with an electric charge. When the car's recharging, electricity is used to make chemical changes inside its batteries. When it's being driven, the batteries are used to discharge power. The EV’s battery thermal management system – or BTMS – allows the lithium battery cells to be rapidly charged to approximately 80%, after which it changes to a trickle charge. The BTMS ensures the battery is kept within its optimum thermal limits, which is why lithium batteries last as long as they do. How long do electric car batteries last? The hundreds of topped-up cells inside an EV battery mean that each battery pack is expected to retain its charging-discharging capacity from 100,000 to 200,000 miles. Manufacturers are so confident of the battery’s road use that most electric cars come with an extended warranty of eight years, or 100,000 miles. Today, most EV batteries have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years within the car – and a second life beyond. It’s also worth noting that EV battery technology is still evolving, so as tech develops we expect batteries’ lifespan to increase – as well as becoming cheaper, smaller and even lighter. What happens to EV batteries when they no longer power cars reliably and quickly? Once an EV battery starts to lose its capacity to power a vehicle over distance, it still has useable life in it. When an electric car battery’s performance drops to 70% or less, its ‘second life’ revs into action. There’s still residual life in the viable battery, so it can be hung in your garage or in the cupboard under the stairs as a static battery energy storage system, if you have a renewable energy source like solar panels . This EV battery second stage usefulness, when paired with renewable energy, means people can save on bills and increase their use of clean energy . A green cycle for EV batteries? Aside from energy storage in your home or workplace, on a larger scale former EV batteries can be used to power manufacturing plants and streets. In a virtuous energy cycle, eventually the factories that produce the batteries could be powered using the repurposed batteries. Electric vehicle manufacturers are making big investments to give car batteries a new lease of life in large-scale battery storage systems . Nissan is using retired EV batteries to provide back-up power to the Amsterdam Arena – the entertainment centre and home to Ajax Football Club. Toyota will be installing ex-EV batteries outside convenience stores in Japan . The batteries will be used to store power generated from solar panels. The energy stored will then be used to support the power of drink fridges, food warmers and fresh food counters inside stores. Renault has also announced that the EV batteries from the Renault Zoe EV will be repurposed to generate power to the Powervault – a home energy battery storage system. And Nissan has launched XStorage, using Nissan Leaf car batteries as storage systems for homes and businesses. Will EV batteries be recycled at the end of their working life? Yes, when EV batteries reach the end of their working life, they will be recycled. In the US, w hen the typical 8- to 10-year battery warranty has expired, most EV providers can reuse the batteries for a second or third time. As electric cars take pole position on our roads – reducing greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution compared to cars powered by fossil fuels – the race is on to find ever better recycling methods to unlock their full green potential. The active battery recycling market is in its infancy, as car batteries are so reliable and long-lived. But we can expect to see huge growth in recycling technologies, as it makes neither economic nor environmental sense for EV batteries to be dumped in landfill. The current methods of smelting and leaching will be finessed in coming years, as will the battery designs to optimise the separation and recycling process of end-of-life batteries. In the UK, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) has launched a £7million ($8.5m) competition for on-vehicle solutions that address challenges associated with the transition to zero emission vehicles, including improving sustainability. The former Chief Technical Officer of Tesla, J. B. Straubel, has launched Redwood Materials , one of a crowd of new start-ups racing to solve a problem that doesn’t exist yet; how to recycle electric car batteries that will be past their prime. Straubel told Wired : “With all these batteries in circulation, it just seems super obvious that eventually we're going to build a remanufacturing ecosystem.” Find out more about the future of transport Read more of our EV stories Sources 1 GOV.UK: Outcome and response to ending the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans 2 The Guardian: Biden sets goal for 50% of new US vehicles to be electric by 2030 3 CNBC: Biden announces standards to make electric vehicle charging stations accessible Similar reading Connections reform decision is a milestone on the road to Clean Power 2030 15  Apr  2025 Our president of electricity transmission, Alice Delahunty, reflects on Ofgem’s connections reform decision, and why it heralds a key step towards Britain’s clean energy goals. 10 myths about climate change busted 28  Nov  2024 We get lots of questions about the real threat climate change poses to our world.

It’s a handsome machine that doesn’t try too hard to be an aero car, is super-smooth and refined and drives much like the big Audi saloons you’ve seen before.” Read the full Audi A6 Avant e-tron review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Renault Megane E-Tech Electric “This Renault is slick to drive, so you might briefly be tempted into range-blunting speeds that negate the car's clever efficiency measures. Go sensibly though and the range compromise is enough for most. As for the non-electric parts of it, the Megane is conventionally desirable, handsome, and the cabin is well-finished and easy to use. There's very little wrong with it. Which is more than can be said of the ID.3.” Read the full Renault Megane Electric review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Macan “Porsche hasn’t dulled the Macan’s sheen with the switch to electric. If you want an incredibly well-rounded daily to deal with everyday life, the Macan stands out. It’s fast, comfortable, well-made and eminently practical - even more so than the ICE versions - and in Turbo form it’ll stay with a serious sportscar. “The main thrust is really the breadth of ability rather than one big headline; a comfy car in town with enough handling finesse to make it fun on a twisty bit of road. Where other mid-sized electric SUVs run out of ideas, the Macan gets going. It’s not cheap, but an absolutely solid effort from Porsche, and best-in-class.” Read the full Porsche Macan review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Advertisement - Page continues below Fiat Grande Panda “The Grande Panda is an excellently low-cost and practical supermini – petrol or electric – with pretty special design. In a world where superminis are getting very little love from the manufacturers, that's a win. “The general aspect nods towards crossovers, and the detailing is heartwarming and original. All of which applied to the original Panda in 1980. This is a return for Fiat to doing what it has always done best.” Read the full Fiat Grande Panda review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Dacia Spring “The Spring’s appeal is that it’s everything that many electric cars aren’t: it’s not over-wrought or heavy-handed, it’s honest and enjoyable and manages to keep the dream of a low impact electric car alive and proves to everyone else it is possible for a battery electric vehicle to weigh largely the same as its petrol equivalent. Well done Dacia, let’s hope that where you lead, others will follow.” Read the full Dacia Spring review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Skoda Elroq “The Skoda Elroq follows closely in the Enyaq’s footsteps, and for good reason. That car proved better than either of its VW Group siblings, and the Elroq - debuting Skoda’s new language - looks even smarter. It drives equally as well, and is just as competitively priced too. it oozes Skoda sensibility and will no doubt have competitors glancing nervously in its direction.” Read the full Skoda Elroq review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Volvo EX30 “The audited CO2 footprint of a base-model EX30 out of the factory is only 18 tonnes; not much more than many petrol rivals. The UK electricity it uses to drive for an 8,000-mile year emits about 0.4 tonnes of power-station CO2, where a petrol car would emit 1.8 tonnes from its exhaust. So the EX30's lifetime CO2 is about half that of a petrol.” Read the full Volvo EX30 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Kia EV3 “The EV3 is just so roundly, crushingly competent in the same way a Golf used to be. Keenly priced and promising not to depreciate like a dropped ice lolly on a beach. Easy going and comfy to drive. Right-sized for families and not too bloated to park. It’s a roundly thought-out bit of kit as a ‘car’. And it doesn’t trip up when you factor in the ‘electric’ bit – adequate performance, strong range, and the ability to accept a speedy recharge. Not a given in an entry-level EV.” Read the full Kia EV3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk MG4 “On the face of it, the MG4 doesn’t seem like a very exciting car - certainly not something Top Gear would give a massively high score to. But when you dig into what it does for the money, how high it scores on multiple levels, it’s probably the only car in the class to recommend. It’s got range, charging, equipment, zippy dynamics and now some style.” Read the full MG4 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Tesla Model 3 / Tesla Model Y “This is the future we were promised – a car with sentience, a sense of humour, and a fresh take on the old norms. After trying this, your old repmobile will just feel a bit dull. The Model 3 has been in production since mid-2017, but even heading into old age, nothing on the market has yet managed to beat it on all fronts. While not without flaws, it is quite simply one of the most interesting, compelling cars in the world right now. We might even look back on it as the car that changed the way we all drive.” Read the full Tesla Model 3 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk “A massive improvement to the Model Y from Tesla. It may have taken the company a while to react to the feedback, but they’ve got there in the end. The new Model Y is quieter, more efficient, calmer to drive and nicer to be in. The only issue is that where it was a good distance from the competition, it’s now just about keeping ahead of the curve, and the initial surprise and delight is gone.” Read the full Tesla Model Y review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Porsche Taycan “The Taycan can absolutely entertain on the right road and is a delight to cruise in - a GT with the heart of a sports car. More importantly, it’s a proper Porsche that just happens to run on electricity.” Read the full Porsche Taycan review , the full Taycan Cross Turismo review and the full Sport Turismo review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Rolls-Royce Spectre “Electric has enriched the Rolls-Royce. It’s still a galloping, ocean-going, 24-carat indulgence, but with a tasteful specification it’s just about possible to swerve absolute vulgarity. “It’s rich in the decadence of the so-called glory days but gratifyingly simple to operate for a product of 2023. While other manufacturers wrestle with the conundrum of transposing their family heirloom values into an electric future, the age of electric propulsion will suit Rolls-Royce very well indeed.” Read the full Rolls-Royce Spectre review Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Hyundai Ioniq 5 N “Right now, the Ioniq 5 N is an electric car that's as involving as a really good petrol car. In some ways it does that by brazenly impersonating a petrol drivetrain. The surprising thng is that's absolutely not just a gimmick. “Then in corners it has some original tricks of its own. It's not just fast, it's confident and playful so it's fun even when it's not going fast. It's useful and versatile too. “So it has many of the talents you expect from an electric car, and many more that so far are unique in EVs. Which makes us call it a new and brilliant chapter.” Read the full Hyundai Ioniq 5 N review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Renault 5 “The R5’s not the first premium-retro EV. It shares with the Mini and Fiat 500 a knowing silhouette, lavish external jewellery and a smart, cheery cabin. But it’s bigger than a Fiat 500 and goes further, and it's more practical than the Mini and copes better with bumpy roads. “It's not the cheapest EV either. But looking at performance and range, it's right in the sweet spot, and the bi-directional charging could help subsidise you outlay. Most of all it feels consistent: as charming to drive as it is to look at and to sit in. Your first love should last.” Read the full Renault 5 review Compare new car deals with leasing.com Compare used car deals with DrivenBuy.co.uk Looking for more from the USA?

Research Browse and Compare EVs Incentives Charging and Range EV Listings Research The experts at KBB.com give you everything you need to research and compare Electric Vehicles (EVs) to help you make an informed decision. We’re your guide for “everything electric,” whether you’re just browsing, actively looking, or ready to buy your first – or next – electric car. Pros And Cons Overall, electric cars are a good option if you want to save money on gas and help the environment. However, they do have some limitations. It's important to weigh both the pros and cons before deciding if an electric car is right for you. Pro: Save Money on Gas Electric cars save money on gas because they run on electricity, so you’re not spending any money filling up at the pump. Pro: Good for the Environment Electric cars produce less pollution than traditional cars because they don’t emit exhaust gases, keeping the air cleaner and healthier. Pro: Quiet Electric cars are extremely quiet because they have fewer moving parts. This means there’s no loud engine noise while driving. Pro: Less Maintenance Required Electric cars require less maintenance because they have fewer moving parts. You don’t have to worry about changing oil, replacing filters, or other typical maintenance tasks. Con: Expensive Battery Replacement An electric car battery is expensive to replace if it fails. This means you could end up spending a lot of money replacing it. Con: Limited Driving Range Electric cars can only go a certain distance before they need to be recharged, meaning you can’t drive as far on a single charge as you could with a gas-powered car. Con: Limited Charging Infrastructure There aren’t as many charging stations as there are gas stations, so you might have difficulty finding a place to charge if driving a long distance. Con: Higher Upfront Cost Electric cars are generally more expensive to buy than traditional cars. Bottom line? You’ll probably spend more money upfront. Car Advice Electric Cars 101: What You Need to Know About EVs If you are thinking about driving greener with an electric car, you probably wonder what your options are and need… Chris Hardesty May 25, 2025 Car Advice What to Look for When Buying an Electric Car in 2025 Electric vehicles come in many types, and there is not a one size fits all for everybody. Our guide tells you what to consider when EV shopping. Nick Kurczewski January 23, 2025 Advertisement Busting EV Myths and Fears All Electric Cars Feel the Same On the contrary, different automakers go to great lengths to give their specific electric cars a distinct experience. Just like in gasoline-powered cars, manufacturers try to capture the character, look, and feel of their respective brands overall. Performance Cars Need a Rumbling Gas Engine Electric vehicles drive as quickly or even quicker than gas-powered cars, even when it comes to high-dollar performance cars. Drive an EV and you’ll see that gas-powered cars can be viewed as crude, noisy, and unrefined. All Electric Cars Look Ugly At one point this was true, but not anymore. Today’s EVs are not only fun to drive but their looks are sharp, stylish, and luxurious. Automakers can make dramatic design choices because they no longer need to design around a large gas tank. Electric Cars Cost Too Much While it’s true that some EVs are expensive, we’re already seeing some easing in pricing. And don’t forget federal tax credits, state and local rebates, electricity discounts, and even discounted or free home chargers from certain automakers. There’s No Place to Charge Electric Cars Research shows that 80% of EVs are charged at home. Still, drivers need more charging stations. To that end, the federal government has earmarked $5 billion over five years to grow the U.S. network of chargers to 500,000, some five times that of today. Electric Cars Are Unreliable Evidence shows that electric vehicles are just as reliable as gas-powered cars. Plus, EVs typically offer more extensive warranties on the battery and drive components. For example, one automaker covers its EVs for 10 years or 150,000 miles. 1 of 6 Browse and Compare EVs Find the best electric car, SUV or truck for you from the following list provided by the KBB.com editors.

Transport Ebikes Electric Motorcycles Bus Hyperloop Autonomy Tesla Autopilot Cruise Automation Uber Waymo Energy Green Energy Climate Tesla Shop Store Toggle dark mode Hyundai Hyundai IONIQ 5 Hyundai Kona EV Hyundai is halting IONIQ 5 and Kona EV production in Korea for the fourth time this year Peter Johnson | Jun 25 2025 - 11:49 am PT 11 Comments For the fourth time this year, Hyundai is temporarily halting EV production in Korea. Starting June 25, Hyundai will suspend output on a line at its Ulsan Plant dedicated to building the IONIQ 5 and Kona Electric. Why is Hyundai halting EV production in Korea again? After pausing production at its Ulsan Plant 1 in Korea in February, April, and May , Hyundai is set to do it again in June. According to industry sources, Hyundai will halt production on Line 2 at its Ulsan Plant 1, which produces IONIQ 5 and Kona EV models. The suspension begins on Wednesday, June 25, and will last for only three days, ending on June 27. Although some believe it’s a sign of slowing demand for electric vehicles, Hyundai may simply be adjusting its inventory. Advertisement - scroll for more content Like most of the industry, the Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, is competing for its share of the global market against low-cost competitors like BYD, which is quickly expanding overseas. The news comes after a report on Wednesday claimed BYD is also slowing production in China. Exports of the popular IONIQ 5 declined 69% last month to 2,449 units, down from nearly 8,000 in May 2024. Kona EV exports also fell sharply to 234 units, representing an 83.3% decrease from last year. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 (Source: Hyundai) In Europe, Hyundai and Kia’s vehicle registrations are down 5%through May compared to the same period last year. Although Hyundai and Kia’s exports to the US were down 21.5% last month to 77,892 units, it’s likely due to local production coming online. Hyundai IONIQ 9 (Source: Hyundai) Hyundai celebrated the grand opening of its massive new EV plant in Georgia earlier this year, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). Hyundai has been building the new 2025 IONIQ 5 at the facility since last year, while its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, joined it in March. The new facility is capable of producing up to 300,000 vehicles a year, but capacity could be expanded to around 500,000 if needed. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 at a Tesla Supercharger (Source: Hyundai) Hyundai’s electric vehicles remain among the most affordable and efficient EVs available in the US. The new 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 starts at $60,555 with a range of up to 335 miles. Like the new IONIQ 5, Hyundai’s three-row electric SUV features a built-in NACS port, allowing it to charge at Tesla Superchargers. The upgraded 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5, now with a range of up to 318 miles and an improved style both inside and out, starts at $42,500. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 Trim EV Powertrain Driving Range (miles) Starting Price* Monthly lease price June 2025 IONIQ 5 SE RWD Standard Range 168-horsepower rear motor 245 $42,500 $179 IONIQ 5 SE RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $46,550 $199 IONIQ 5 SEL RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $49,500 $209 IONIQ 5 Limited RWD 225-horsepower rear motor 318 $54,200 $309 IONIQ 5 SE Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 290 $50,050 $249 IONIQ 5 SEL Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 290 $53,000 $259 IONIQ 5 XRT Dual Motor  AWD 320 horsepower dual motor 259 $55,400 $359 IONIQ 5 Limited Dual Motor AWD 320-horsepower dual motor 269 $58,100 $299 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 prices and range by trim (*includes $1,475 destination fee) After Hyundai cut lease prices last month, you can now snag the 2025 IONIQ 5 for as little as $179 per month. The IONIQ 9 is listed for lease starting at $419 per month. Both are still eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, as long as it remains in effect. To throw in a little extra, Hyundai is offering a free ChargePoint Home Flex Level 2 charger with the purchase of any new 2026 IONIQ 9 or 2025 IONIQ 5. Looking to test one out for yourself?

But which are the brightest sparks – and which are the loose connections?... by Darren Moss Published 09 February 2025 If you don't think that electric cars are yet in the mainstream of the new car market, then consider this – in 2024, almost one-in-five new car buyers chose one. And while the majority of those purchases came from businesses and company car fleets, that still means that thousands of customers chose a new electric car. Those buyers have more choice than ever, too, whether they're looking for a small electric car , an electric SUV , or something in between. There are also more brands to choose from, whether buyers want to choose from a traditional brand such as Audi or BMW, to one of the newer electric-only brands such as Polestar, or from a so-called 'Chinese' car brand like Xpeng or Ora. All of that choice means that knowing which EVs will leave you feeling fully charged and which are the not-so-bright sparks is more important than ever – and it's where this story can help. Our expert team of road testers has spent thousands of hours testing every new electric car on the market, focussing on the areas which matter most – from refinement to range, and from performance to practicality. And that means that when we name the best electric cars in the country, it's backed up by the most rigorous test regime around. Here, we reveal our top 10 electric cars, and tell you which model is better avoided. You can find out more about each model, and see the latest deals on each car, by clicking the links through to our reviews. Plus, we've answered some of the most common questions about electric cars at the bottom of this page. The latest What Car? Reliability Survey is live, tell us about your car now 1 Renault 5 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Grown-up driving manners Great infotainment system Tempting pricing Weaknesses Rear leg room is tight Small discounts Citroën ë-C3 and Fiat Grande Panda Electric are even cheaper With Instagram-worthy looks and a choice of bright colour schemes, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the new Renault 5 was a car built on style rather than substance. You'd be wrong, though, because even amid the crowded field of electric cars presented here, it's an outstanding champion. Indeed, we like it so much that we've made the Renault 5 our Car of the Year for 2025. Let's start with how far the 5 can take you between charges, with even entry-level models officially capable of taking you up to 193 miles on a charge. Go for our recommended 52kWh battery, though, and that figure jumps to 253 miles – plenty for most buyers, especially if you can charge at home. And speaking of charging, you'll be waiting a similar amount of time for a 10-80% top-up as you would for the rival Citroën ë-C3 , Mini Cooper SE and Peugeot e-208 . Inside, you'll find a comfortable and practical interior with a superb Google-based infotainment system that's easy to get along with. Plus, its physical climate controls are easier to use on the move than the purely screen or voice-based controls of some rivals. And while anyone approaching six-feet tall is inclined to feel a bit cramped in the rear seats over long journeys, the 5's boot is larger than those of the Fiat 500 or Mini. Then there's the price, because even the most expensive Renault 5 will cost you less than £30,000, which is more than £1000 less than the cheapest Mini Cooper SE. ""Unlike some rivals, there's no mechanical connection between the 5's brake pedal and the brakes themselves. I was nervous about this, but I needn't have been – teh system makes it easier to slow down smoothly than in rival electric cars"" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth Renault 5 review New car deals What Car? best price £22,995 Used car deals Finance this car with Drivenfi 2 Tesla Model 3 Reliability Safety Costs Quality Performance Strengths Fast and reliable charging via Tesla's Supercharger network Long range between charges Surprisingly practical Weaknesses Fiddly interior controls Handling not as entertaining as the best petrol-powered rivals Windscreen pillars hamper visibility Since its launch in 2019, the Tesla Model 3 has consistently been one of our favourite electric cars. Now, thanks to its latest round of updates, it’s the model to beat if you're looking for an electric car which matches up to the best executive models . The Model 3 is great to drive, offering sweeter handling than the rival Kia EV6 or Polestar 2 . It’s fast, too (ridiculously so in Performance guise), and surprisingly practical. The near-complete lack of physical buttons and switches (even the indicator stalk has been replaced with haptic buttons on the steering wheel) won’t suit everyone, but the enormous 15.4in central screen is at least pretty user-friendly. Factor in that the Model 3 is also competitively priced, and that buying one gets you access to the brand’s ultra-fast and convenient Supercharger network , and it’s easy to recommend. ""Every time we test a Tesla, it proves vastly more efficient than its rivals; the Model 3 averaged 3.7 miles per kilowatt hour of electricity used on our real-world test route."" – Will Nightingale, Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Tesla Model 3 review New car deals What Car? best price £39,990 Leasing deals from £287 pm Nearly new deals from £32,558 Finance this car with Drivenfi 3 Kia EV3 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Attractive entry price Long range (especially in the, er, Long Range) Comfortable ride Weaknesses Rivals have more versatile rear seats Not very agile Monthly PCP repayments are fairly high Kia's smallest and most affordable electric SUV has had some very impressive siblings to learn from – after all, the larger Kia EV6 is a former What Car? Car of the Year, while the even larger Kia EV9 is among our favourite electric seven-seaters. It certainly starts off on the right note, with even the most affordable models able to officially cover 270 miles on a charge, while the Long Range model ups that figure to 375 miles – more than the rival Hyundai Kona Electric , Mini Aceman or Smart #3 can manage. The Kia beats the Aceman and matches the Kona Electric on boot space, too, and we managed to fit six carry-on suitcases inside – the same as the Skoda Elroq . Speaking of the Elroq, the EV3's physical climate controls make it easier to adjust the temperature in that car, while elsewhere the Kia's interior impresses with an infotainment system that's easy to get along with, and the kind of high-up driving position which SUV buyers will love. When you're driving around town, the EV3's soft suspension does a good job of soaking up lumps and bumps, but the downside is that it doesn't make the car feel especially agile, and it leans more through corners than some rivals. ""If you're an audiophile like me, it might be worth looking at the range-topping EV3's kit list. That's because in GT-Line S trim, it comes with a premium stereo from Harman Kardon – perfect for your commuting soundtrack"" – Oliver Young, Used Cars Reporter Read our in-depth Kia EV3 review New car deals What Car? best price £30,550 Save up to £2,445 Leasing deals from £372 pm Nearly new deals from £25,495 Finance this car with Drivenfi 4 Skoda Elroq Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Comfortable yet good the drive Very roomy in the back Well priced and equipped Weaknesses Rear seats don't do anything clever No physical climate controls Heat pump costs extra Welcome to Britain's best family electric SUV . And to give the Skoda Elroq that honour makes complete sense – after all, it's about the same size and offers many of the same features as the Skoda Karoq, which is one of our favourite family SUVs, but benefits from electric power. Speaking of power, even entry-level 168bhp versions of the Karoq feel plenty quick enough, and the standard suspension setup does a good job of ironing out lumps and bumps in the road. The Elroq handles well for a family SUV, too, with well-weighted steering that's also accurate. It's just a shame that the brakes don't offer a better sense of feeling, but that's a problem which also affects the rival Cupra Tavascan . Inside, you don't sit as high up as you do in the Tesla Model Y , but there's a decent amount of space for adults. Plus, we managed to fit six carry-on suitcases into the Elroq's boot, which means your holiday luggage shouldn't be much trouble. It's worth noting that the rival Renault Scenic managed to carry one more case in our tests, though. ""When I was faced with picking up some flat-pack furniture, I was pleased to find the Elroq has a handy ski hatch, so I could load longer items through the middle of the car from the boot."" – Doug Revolta, Head of Video Read our in-depth Skoda Elroq review New car deals What Car? best price £29,798 Save up to £5,112 Leasing deals from £348 pm Nearly new deals from £26,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi 5 Volkswagen ID Buzz Reliability Safety Costs Quality Performance Strengths Surprisingly good to drive Hugely practical Strong resale values Weaknesses Fiddly air-con controls and infotainment Efficiency could be better The LWB version doesn't ride as smoothly as the SWB There’s so much affection for the retro design of the Volkswagen ID Buzz that its maker could easily have penny-pinched on the engineering and still sold as many as it could make. Instead, the German brand has clearly thrown everything at the car, and this has resulted in something that combines the practicality of an MPV with the comfort and refinement of a premium SUV and the low running costs of an electric car. The ID Buzz is good to drive – it can sprint up to motorway speeds faster than many conventional family SUV s, such as the 1.5-litre petrol-engined Volkswagen Tiguan – and is endlessly spacious, meaning more space for passengers and luggage than you'd find in a Jaguar I-Pace or Tesla Model Y . And in LWB form, it's one of the most spacious cars you can buy in any class. ""I've not come close to maxing out the ID Buzz's available boot space yet – even on trips to Ikea and the tip."" – Stuart Milne, Digital Editor Read our in-depth Volkswagen ID Buzz review New car deals What Car? best price £51,630 Save up to £8,975 Leasing deals from £490 pm Nearly new deals from £41,950 Finance this car with Drivenfi 6 Renault Scenic Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Bigger battery version offers a long range Cheaper than many rivals Five-star Euro NCAP safety rating Weaknesses Rear seat versatility could be better Spongy brake pedal feel Not particularly quick In times gone by, the Renault Scenic was a fairly frumpy family MPV which, although spacious, didn't have much else going for it. That's certainly not the case with the latest version, though, which has morphed into a cutting-edge electric car. To drive, the latest Scenic combines a long range – up to 379 miles, according to official figures – with the kind of pep which should make overtaking or getting the jump on urban traffic a breeze. Indeed, the 168bhp version can hit 62mph in around the same time as a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Skoda Enyaq . The rival Kia Niro EV or Tesla Model Y are even nippier still, though. The Model Y also places you farther from the road, but drivers seeking the kind of high-up SUV-style driving position which gives you a good view over the road ahead will be pleased with the Scenic. There's good head and leg room no matter which seat you're in, and you can fit more into the Renault's boot than you could into the Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6. Despite its lengthy list of attributes, the Scenic remains competitively priced, costing about the same as a Skoda Enyaq. Plus, resale values are expected to be stronger than those of most rivals. ""I was impressed with the Solarbay sunroof which comes on the Scenic's Iconic trim – it allows you to electronically darken sections of the roof, meaning the kids can stay in shade while you enjoy the sunshine up front."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Renault Scenic review New car deals What Car? best price £37,195 Used car deals Finance this car with Drivenfi 7 BMW i7 Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Stunning interior Impressive optional 8K cinema screen Extremely comfy for all occupants Weaknesses Desirable options are very expensive Boot has a comparatively small opening If you're lucky enough to have someone do your driving for you, then the BMW i7 is one of the best luxury limousines on sale, offering technology, comfort and convenience in equal measure. Even if you're doing the driving yourself, though, it still out-shines its rivals. Entry-level models make do with 'just' 449bhp from a single motor, and that's enough to haul this luxury limo to motorway speeds in just 5.5sec. The other, four-wheel drive i7s, are nothing short of ballistically fast. Indeed, the eDrive60 xDrive will out-sprint the rival Mercedes EQS to 62mph. Not that there's much drama to be felt when reaching those speeds, though, because the i7 is as serene and as hushed as a Swiss watch. And with a cushioning ride, every trip is relaxing. From any seat, you'll be immersed in an interior that's both luxurious and filled with technology, while your luggage should have no trouble fitting inside the 500-litre boot. The EQS is even more capacious, though, and benefits from a more practical hatchback-style opening. ""Not that I'm one for sleeping on the job, but the i7's optional Executive Pack can replace the outer rear seats with lounge-style alternatives which, among other things, can fold down into a bed."" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth BMW i7 review New car deals What Car? best price £79,999 Save up to £21,776 Leasing deals from £1,452 pm Nearly new deals from £79,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi 8 Porsche Taycan Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Staggering performance and engaging handling Great potential battery range Wonderful interior quality Weaknesses It's very expensive... ...and you’ll probably want to add some options Reliability has been a concern The Porsche Taycan has long since ranked among our favourite electric cars – and this latest version has benefitted from a round of updates designed to make it even better to drive, even among a field of outstanding rivals. And, as you can see by its spot on this list, it's worked. Frankly, the Taycan is in a different league altogether from almost every other eletric car. Its steering, for example, is sweeter than that of the Mercedes EQS. And while entry-level models deliver plenty enough power for most drivers, the 4S model which we recommend can take you to 62mph even faster than an Audi E-tron GT quattro. Despite having more power than before, the Taycan can still take you a long way between charges. The 4S is officially rated for 346 miles, or 399 miles if you go for the optional larger battery. That's enough to get you from London to Glasgow without stopping, if you so wish. And you likely won't want to stop, because that could mean leaving the Taycan's sumptuous interior, which is beautifully finished and offers an excellent driving position. ""There's lots to like about the Taycan, but I think it's a shame that some of the functions for which its Audi E-tron GT sister car offers physical controls, the Taycan doesn't. Hitting some of the smaller icons on its infotainment touchscreen can be a pain while driving."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Porsche Taycan review New car deals What Car? best price £86,990 Save up to £4,000 Nearly new deals from £74,500 Finance this car with Drivenfi 9 Hyundai Inster Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths Surprising amount of interior space Competitive electric range Lots of standard kit Weaknesses Renault 5 is better to drive Quite sluggish at higher speeds Limited to four seats Just because you've decided to go electric doesn't mean that you need to spend a lot on your new car. Indeed, the Hyundai Inster will cost you less than rivals including the BYD Dolphin, Fiat 500e and MG4 . It's not like you'll be scrimping on kit if you go for an entry-level version, either, because features including 15in alloy wheels, climate control, keyless entry and start and even an EV heat pump all come as standard. Drivers have two batteries to choose from, with the smaller 36kWh capable of taking you up to 203 miles officially. The larger 46kWh battery ups the official range to 229 miles, which is further than rivals such as the Dacia Spring and Dolphin can manage. There is evidence inside that the Inster has been built to a budget, with plenty of scratchy plastics on display, but the seats are comfortable and the Inster's driving position is sound. A word of warning, though, because there's only two seats in the rear, meaning a family of five will end up leaving someone behind. ""I was impressed that even at this relatively modest price point, Hyundai hasn't skimped on technology – the Inster's infotainment screen is quick to respond, for example, while every version gets a 10.25in digital driver's display. You don't get that in a Dacia Spring."" – Neil Winn, Deputy Reviews Editor Read our in-depth Hyundai Inster review New car deals What Car? best price £20,499 Save up to £3,006 Leasing deals from £290 pm Nearly new deals from £21,500 Finance this car with Drivenfi 10 BMW iX Driving Interior Practicality Buying & Owning Strengths One of the quietest cars we’ve ever tested Spacious and luxurious interior Great infotainment system Weaknesses Air suspension only standard on top-spec M70 Fiddly air-con controls Quicker depreciation than rivals BMW's largest and most luxurious SUV has always been easy to recommend, thanks to its combination of a long range and supreme comfort. And now, thanks to a wide range of updates, it promises to be even better. The headline figure is 426 miles – that's how far the updated iX can take you between charges, and means that even commuters who travel hundreds of miles in a day should find that they don't have to charge up with every journey. Then there's the power, which has been upped across the range. It means that even the entry-level 45 model produces 402bhp, while the range-topping M70 produces 659bhp. Most versions of the iX are quick to charge, too, with speeds of up to 195kW possible. ""I was worried that the iX would lose its intuitive rotary dial as part of its most recent facelift, and was overjoyed to see it remains – it makes operating the enormous infotainment screen that much easier."" – Dan Jones, Reviewer Read our in-depth BMW iX review For all the latest reviews, advice and new car deals, sign up to the What Car? newsletter here New car deals What Car? best price £67,619 Save up to £9,096 Leasing deals from £791 pm Nearly new deals from £48,995 Finance this car with Drivenfi And the electric car to avoid... Skywell BE11 A competitive range and a long warranty isn't enough to salvage the BE11 from being at the bottom of the electric car pile – it's simply behind the curve in too many other areas to recommend. Read our review How we choose the best electric cars Every new electric car (EV) we assess is put through our comprehensive testing regime , which covers everything from performance and handling to practicality and running costs. However, we understand that EV owners’ needs can differ significantly from those of petrol and diesel car owners. That’s why we conduct an annual reader survey, in which we ask drivers of all kinds what topped their list of priorities when buying a new car . Here are the top three considerations among electric car buyers: Buying & ownership costs – a key attribute for 67% of electric car buyers Electric cars are typically more expensive to buy than equivalent petrol and diesel cars, but the best also promise to slash your running costs – especially if you charge your EV at  home. We weigh each new electric car against its closest rivals in both of these areas, considering  its list price, our Target Price discounts, monthly PCP rates, depreciation , servicing costs, insurance premiums and efficiency. Performance – a key attribute for 64% of electric car buyers We use highly sophisticated GPS logging equipment to measure a car’s acceleration and braking performance in a variety of situations, to make sure the way the car drives is fit for  purpose. We also consider subjective factors, such as smoothness of power delivery. Smoothness/quietness – a key attribute for 60% of electric car buyers Long journeys can be dramatically improved by a car which does a good job of isolating you from noise and vibration. That’s especially true in electric cars, where there’s no engine noise to cover up other sounds. We measure the sound inside each car we test in decibels at 30mph and 70mph, and conduct subjective tests to identify the source of any noises or vibrations, and find out when exactly they occur. Our expert road testers also assess how easy a car is to drive smoothly; some electric cars have overly grabby brakes, which can be disconcerting. You can read more about our full test programme in our how we test cars feature. FAQs Is it still worth buying an electric car in the UK? If going electric suits you over getting a conventional petrol or diesel car, a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid , then there can be significant benefits. The first of those is the potential for low running costs, especially if you have access to a charging point at home or your place of work. If you solely rely on the UK's growing public charging network to charge your electric car, it can be costly. Electric cars also make a lot of sense if you're a company car driver, since their lack of CO2 emissions means they'll cost you just 2% in Benefit In Kind tax – although that rate won't stay that low forever. Will electric cars get any cheaper? As with any new technology, electric cars are likely to get cheaper as the technology improves and develops, and the manufacturing process becomes cheaper. We’re already seeing more affordable electric cars being launched, including the Dacia Spring , MG4 and Renault 5 , which are bringing the starting price of electric models down significantly. And as more people buy them, the cheaper they'll become. What is the difference between an EV and an electric car? An electric car is a type of electric vehicle (EV). An EV can include any vehicle, from a car to a bus, which is powered by a battery and an electric motor. Which electric car holds its value best? According to our exclusive data, the Volvo EX30 in Twin Motor Performance Plus form is the electric car which will hold its value the best across 36,000 miles or three years of ownership. Indeed, it'll be worth almost 64% of its original value after that time. Other electric cars which hold their value well include the Lotus Eletre electric SUV, and the Porsche Macan Electric SUV. At the other end of the scale, our data shows that the Nissan Leaf is the electric car which loses the biggest percentage of its value over three years.

BMW history and evolution From planes to motorcycles, kitchen utensils to race cars, BMW has produced many things over its 100 plus years in business. Originally established as an aircraft manufacturer, BMW released their first motorcycle, the R32, in 1923, and their first car, the Dixi 3/15, in 1928. Post-WWII, the company struggled to find their footing. The 1952 BMW 501 sedan helped the company regain its reputation for making exciting luxury vehicles. The 1961 BMW 1500, the first of the New Class line, turned BMW back into a profitable carmaker. The 1970s saw the launch of the BMW 3-Series, 5-Series and 7-Series, the success of which continues today. The BMW i3, the first all-electric BMW, launched in 2013, paving the way towards the company's growing selection of hybrid and electric models today. Popular BMW models to look for Now in its seventh generation, the BMW 3-Series is a line of extremely popular compact luxury cars. The 2021 BM",Y,Y,N

Gallery Show all 11 photos There’s no doubt about it: reviewing cars is a pretty cool gig. Sure, we can complain about jet lag (and get no sympathy), or whine about nutty schedules and brutal deadlines (no sympathy again), or try to convey the sad truth that when flying to cool exotic locales to drive expensive cars, we generally have barely enough time to drive the vehicle, take the pictures, and shoot video (no sympathy v3). And don’t get me started on motion sickness when riding shotgun through the mountains of Calabria in a Porsche. Yeah, I know. Boo-hoo. Get out the violins. Still, we here at AutoTrader take our responsibilities seriously, and for this writer, perhaps the best part of the job is sharing the wealth. I appreciate how fortunate we are to drive these vehicles, and I’ll never take that for granted. Hence, when a cool press car visits chez-Bleakney, my friends and neighbours can count on rides. And if someone approaches me in a parking lot and shows a modicum of interest, they’d better be ready for a full-length review. “Buddy",N,N,N

Company Pricing See a Demo Now Login See a Demo Now Login News Electric Vehicles vs. Gas Vehicles: How Do the Costs Compare? Last Updated: August 18, 2024 Last year, gas prices were surging. This year, it’s the cost of electricity spiking. Every time costs soar for one of these energy options, one can’t help but wonder if the other would’ve been the smarter, more affordable option for your choice in vehicle. When it comes to costs of operating a gas vs. an electric or hybrid vehicle , who’s actually getting the short end of the stick shift? Let’s get into it. Are Electric Vehicles More Expensive? According to analysis by a Michigan-based public policy firm, Anderson Economic Group, in the first half of 2023, for most classes of vehicles, it cost more money to drive a mile on electricity than on gas. People with gas-powered, mid-sized cars and crossovers used $11.08 worth of gas to drive 100 miles, while owners of electric vehicles paid $12.62 to charge their cars to travel the same distance—if they charged at home. The cost per 100 miles for drivers using public chargers was $16.10. Oh, So Electric Vehicles Are More Expensive? Not necessarily. For one thing, these figures depend on how exactly the cost is calculated. Anderson’s figures here take into account the (presumably) one-time cost to install a home charging system for an EV, along with other costs like taxes, and the projected cost of travel to gas or charging stations. Anderson’s analysis also makes assumptions about the prices of electricity for EV owners, which can vary widely. Furthermore, this study doesn’t take into account the cost-saving options that exist for EV owners. Many utility companies allow owners of electric vehicles to charge their cars at discounted prices overnight and other off-peak times, and some offer rebates to install home chargers. Some manufacturers even offer free charging for newly purchased EVs, as well. Finally, the Anderson study factors in a dollar cost of the “time burden” of charging electric vehicles. According to their calculations (based on charging times and typical hourly wages), the driver of a luxury electric vehicle paid a “time burden” of about $400 a month if they mostly charged their vehicle using commercial chargers. Those who fueled up with gasoline spent only a projected $33 worth of time waiting at the pump. While yes, it does take longer to charge a car than fill it with gas, charging overnight isn’t that inconvenient. And since most people aren’t paid to sleep, the comparison to lost hourly wages doesn’t quite hold up. So…Are Gas Vehicles More Expensive? Some would argue that in the long run it’s actually costlier to own and operate a vehicle that uses gas than an electric vehicle. A 2020 study conducted by the Department of Energy calculated that electric vehicle owners save almost $15,000 in fuel costs over fifteen years of driving an electric car instead of one using gas. After all, as anyone who drives a gas vehicle will tell you, prices at the pump can really add up. The Truth of the Matter So is it cheaper to own and operate a gas vehicle, or an electric vehicle? Well, the truth is…it’s complicated! Many factors contribute to the costs of both gas and electric vehicles. Electric vehicles famously have higher sticker prices than gas vehicles, but as the market grows, those price margins are expected to shrink , and sometimes tax incentives can shrink an EV’s price tag. On the flip side, you might have to shell out around $2,000 to install a charging station (however, incentives often exist for those as well). Obviously gas prices are a massive factor in vehicle costs. But fuel prices vary , often quite widely, from state to state. Likewise, not only does the price of electricity vary similarly, but the price of recharging a vehicle varies widely from model to model, and make to make. Ultimately, the best financial choice for one person in one part of the country may be extremely different from that of someone living somewhere else.

"2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Review: Expert Insights, Pricing, and Trims MotorTrend MotorTrend News Reviews Buyer's Guide Videos The Future Events Ask MOTORTREND Beta Home / Cars / Hyundai / Ioniq 5 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 in Electric Compact SUVs 9.3 /10 Rating 2025 2024 2023 2022 More Compare Price $42,600 - $66,200 9.3 /10 124 Photos Specs See Local Listings Price $42,600 - $66,200 See Local Listings Pros Fast charge speed Spacious, premium interior Standout styling Cons Remains pricey A ride on the stiff side N model's low range 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Expert Review Reviewed by Duncan Brady Our 2023 SUV of the Year is set to become even more impressive. For the 2025 model year, Hyundai gives the Ioniq 5 a comprehensive refresh with revised styling, improved battery capacity, Tesla Supercharger capability, and even an off-road variant. Additionally, the new Ioniq 5 N delivers exciting performance, following in the footsteps of the Veloster N, Elantra N, and Kona N. What’s New • Restyled front and rear, new wheels • XRT variant promises better off-road capability • High-performance N model • NACS port, providing access to Tesla’s Supercharger network without using an adapter • Increased battery capacity • Updated range • Body, doors, and B-pillar parts have been reinforced for improved side crash protection • Rear windshield wiper and washer • More powerful infotainment system with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto • Redesigned HVAC controls • Revised center console with physical heated front seat controls • New steering wheel design • Heated rear seats added to SEL trim and above • New safety features • Hyundai Digital Key 2 Premium available • USB Type-C ports front and rear • New paint colors: Atlas White Matte, Ecotronic Gray Matte, Celadon Gray Matte What We Think We waited far too long for a mainstream alternative to the ubiquitous Tesla Model Y . That car finally arrived for 2022 with the Ioniq 5. Hyundai delivered an EV that looks futuristic and retro at the same time. Its generously spacious cabin integrates smart features and functionalities, and the interior design isn't as minimalist (read: cheap) as some competitors. Thankfully, Hyundai also built a vehicle with a refined driving experience . Acceleration is more than adequate, and buyers will appreciate the balance between a comfortable ride and controlled handling. That said, we wouldn't mind a bit more plushness, as the ride can get jittery on some surfaces. We'll have to see if the refresh changes these characteristics. Based on our prototype track drive of the high-performance Ioniq 5 N and a bit of time with the production version (and its clever N e-Shift software), Hyundai's new electric superhatch is the best-driving EV short of a Porsche Taycan. It's also the quickest SUV we've ever tested (for now, anyway). Through all our experiences with the Ioniq 5 (including a year-long loan living with one), we've yet to find any indication that Hyundai isn't a new leader among mainstream electric vehicles. With a monumental N model at the top of the lineup, the automaker may be a leader in the electric sports car space before we know it. Range, Batteries, and Charging First what you really want to know: How far can the Ioniq 5 travel on a charge? The SE Standard Range, which pairs with RWD and the smaller battery, should get over 240 miles of range, Hyundai says. That's an improvement of 20 miles over the previous model. For SE, SEL, and Limited models with RWD and the bigger battery, range increases from 303 miles to more than 310 miles. Dual-motor AWD models get anywhere from over 250 miles to over 280 miles, depending on configuration. As is often the case, we haven't quite been able to match the EPA's range estimates in our real-world experience with past Ioniq 5 cars. A long-term 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 5 we tested for a year never covered more than 220 miles on a charge even though it is EPA rated at around 260 miles. We've praised the Ioniq 5's recharge speed, and charging should be even easier this year. The Ioniq 5 is the first Hyundai to come equipped with the Tesla North American Charging Standard (NACS) port, which the automaker says effectively doubles the size of the DC fast-charger network available to new Ioniq 5 drivers. The Ioniq 5 receives increased battery capacities this year. Standard Range models get a 63.0-kWh battery, up from 58.0 kWh on the previous model. Long Range variants receive a 84.0-kWh unit, up from 77.4. In terms of performance, we expect 168 hp from the SE Standard Range, 225 hp from the long-range RWD model, and 320 hp from the dual-motor AWD model. The Game-Changing Ioniq 5 N We'd forgive you for thinking the N variant was just an Ioniq 5 with more power (601 hp and 569 lb-ft to be exact), but the reality is way more interesting. The performance model is lower and wider than the standard car, with aerodynamics improved for performance and a rear wing with a new integrated brake light. Inside, Hyundai N fitted aggressive sport bucket seats with a lower seating position and huge bolstering to keep the driver secure through high-g corners. Hyundai improved performance at the foundational stage for the Ioniq 5 N , adding new welding points and additional adhesive to improve body rigidity, and reinforcing the front and rear subframes—basically prepping the standard Ioniq 5 for all the higher forces that come with nearly doubling a car's power output. The N team also implements clever software for launch control, battery conditioning, regenerative braking, drift optimization(!) , and an e-shift mode that provides torque interruption between ""gears"" to simulate some of the drama of a high-performance gas car. This is the future of Hyundai performance, and we couldn't be more excited. Read about how the 2025 Ioniq 5 N fared in MotorTrend's SUV of the Year here. What Is the Ioniq 5 XRT? The Ioniq 5 is no hardcore off-roader, but a new XRT variant increases capability off the beaten path. Along with unique bumpers and side skirts, the XRT model gets all-terrain tires and a 0.9-inch suspension lift with special tuning. Black 18-inch wheels are specific to the XRT model, too. The black theme continues with black window trim, black side sills, black badging, and black mirror caps. Inside the cabin, look for XRT-badged all-weather floormats. Equipped with front tow hooks, towing capacity is 5,834 pounds. The approach angle increases from 17.5 degrees to 19.8 degrees on the XRT, and the departure angle improves from 25.4 degrees to 30.0 degrees. Of course, it's available exclusively with AWD, which enables a 0-60 mph time of 4.5 seconds. After vetting the XRT during our First Test review , we confirmed that the electric SUV is good fun to chuck down a dirt without giving up much daily usability. Impressive Charge Speed Few of the Ioniq 5's affordable electric peers (with the exception of the mechanically similar Kia EV6) can charge nearly as quickly. During our long-term ""ownership"" of a Limited AWD model, we've been able to add 184 miles of range in just 20 minutes. Safety Hyundai introduces new available safety features for the 2025 Ioniq 5. These include a hands-on detection steering wheel, enhanced Remote Smart Parking Assist, and parking collision-avoidance assist in reverse, forward, and side maneuvering. There are eight airbags inside the cabin, including second-row side airbags. Hyundai says the body, doors, and B-pillar parts have been reinforced this year to improve side crash protection. The previous Ioniq 5 already performed well in crash testing, earning an IIHS 2024 Top Safety Pick+ award and a Good rating in the updated side crash test. It also earned a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA. Technology A next-generation infotainment system comes through the car's 12.3-inch center screen. We hope Hyundai has made the screen more responsive, with crisper graphics as part of the update. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all trims. There are now physical controls for popular functions, including heating and ventilation. Over-the-air updates allow Hyundai to continue to evolve vehicle features over time. Prices and On-Sale Date Look for the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 to arrive in dealerships in fall 2024. MSRP info has not yet been announced, but we will likely see increases from the previous model's starting price of around $43,000. Hyundai expects buyers will be eligible for a $3,750 U.S. tax credit, and leases will continue to qualify for the $7,500 credit that Hyundai passes along to consumers.

Hyundai and Kia are offering generous incentives globally, resulting in price cuts worldwide. In some markets, discounts can reach nearly $17,000. Hyundai and Kia cut prices in aggressive sales promotion Hyundai Motor, including Kia, has launched aggressive sales promotions this month in six of its biggest global markets: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The discounts apply to some of its top-selling EVs, including the IONIQ 5 and SUVs like the Tucson and Santa Fe. According to the Korea JoongAng Daily , Hyundai and Kia cut prices by up to 23 million won, or nearly $17,000 in some regions. Advertisement - scroll for more content The promotions vary depending on the market. For example, in Serbia, Hyundai is offering up to 15,000 euros ($17,500) off the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6 models. In Thailand and Chile, discounts reach as high as 12 million won ($8,900) and 17.8 million won ($13,100), respectively. Why is Hyundai offering such significant discounts? The report suggests that it could be all due to the new 25% US auto tariffs on imported vehicles, Hyundai’s largest market. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 (Source: Hyundai) After the tariffs were introduced, Hyundai and Kia reportedly told regional leaders to “increase sales by 10% in other regions.” A local report this week claimed Hyundai was temporarily pausing production of the IONIQ 5 and Kona EV at one of its plants in Korea due to slowing sales. 2026 Kia EV9 (Source: Kia) What about the US? In April, Hyundai launched its “Customer Assurance” program , promising not to raise vehicle prices in the US until June 2. The program has since been extended until July 7. Although Hyundai is expected to hike prices following the window, the company denied the rumors, saying no decision has been made yet. Several automakers have already announced plans to raise vehicle prices in the US, including Toyota , Ford, and Jeep maker Stellantis. 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 at a Tesla Supercharger (Source: Hyundai) About 24% of Hyundai and Kia vehicles sold last year were in the US, making it a priority to protect prices. Although 60% of them were exported from Korea in 2024, Hyundai is ramping up local production to mitigate the blow. After celebrating the grand opening of its new EV plant in Georgia, Hyundai kicked off production of its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9. 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 (Source: Hyundai) The larger electric SUV joins the updated 2025 IONIQ 5, which Hyundai has been building at the facility since last year.

EV charging cables and charger plugs Everything you should know about electric vehicle charging [2023 update] Electric car charging explained for those considering buying their first electric car. Making mobility sustainable Future of electric vehicles Electric mobility and the popularity of electric passenger vehicles has been growing rapidly over the last decade and this trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. However you measure it—EV sales, EVs on the roads, government EV legislation, or simply vehicle manufacturers making electric mobility pledges—it’s undeniable that the future is electric, and the age of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is coming to an end. 26 million EVs in 2022 350 million EVs in 2030 60% total EV share in 2030 1. Are electric cars worth it? Benefits of electric cars As a society, electric vehicles can help us reduce carbon emissions and build a more sustainable future . But as drivers, EVs provide us far more than the ability to reduce our et footprint. More cost savings, a superior performance, and a smaller carbon footprint For one, electric vehicles offer superior driving experience; instant torque and smooth handling (thanks to a low center of gravity ). And let’s be honest, charging when you’re parked at your destination, instead of going out of your way to do so is something you can easily get used to. Next to the added convenience, it can save costs as well. Did you know charging is cheaper than filling up your gas tank? Next to this, EVs require much less maintenance than conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles due to fewer moving parts and no fluids. There are many unanswered questions that (potential) new EV drivers have about EV charging. For people considering buying their first electric vehicle or those who just bought one, driving an EV—or more specifically charging one—is a completely new experience. On this page, we provide an overview of everything you need to know about EV charging and clear up the most common questions so you can feel more confident about switching to electric mobility. 2. Electric vehicles vs. gas EV charging is one of the reasons you should get an electric car Whether you’re in the market for your first EV or considering upgrading, it’s only logical that you’re comparing your options. One of the major differences between owning an EV and a traditional vehicle with an internal combustion engine (ICE) is how you fill your proverbial tank. Many find switching from putting gas in a tank to charging a battery with electricity the scariest transition; what if you run out in the middle of nowhere? In reality, EV range anxiety has as much to do with psychology as it does with the range of electric cars (or the availability of charging stations). In fact, being able to charge your battery is one of the best things about driving an electric car. The biggest difference between driving gas and electric is that when you’re driving electric, you can charge potentially anywhere. EV charging locations It may sound obvious, but with a gas vehicle, you can pretty much only fill up your tank at a gas station. With an EV, however, you can charge your car pretty much everywhere : at home, at the office, at a restaurant, whilst doing your shopping, whilst parked on the street, or you can top-up your car’s battery at a (no longer aptly named) gas station. So, the decision to get an EV and thinking about how to charge it go hand in hand. However, because it works a little differently than what we’re all familiar with, it can get quite confusing, especially because there are many new definitions you have to wrap your head around. Electric car charging explained: why is the terminology so complicated? As a relatively young, scattered, and rapidly growing industry, EV charging terminology is all over the place. There are different charging levels , cables and plugs (which differ depending on where you are), battery capacity possibilities, and estimated actual range . Charging stations can also vary depending on the type of current they use ( AC or DC ), their power output, and their charging speed . It doesn’t help that many EV charging terms are similar and often used interchangeably. For example, how fast is fast charging really? And what is rapid or even ultra-fast charging? If you’re thinking about buying (or have just bought) an EV, then it’s understandable that all this new information can feel a bit overwhelming. Read on to learn everything you need to know about EV charging so you can start your transition toward electric mobility well-informed. 3. Where to charge an electric car? EV charging locations Generally speaking, any location you can park your car in with access to electricity is a potential charging location. So, you can imagine the places you can charge your EV are as diverse as today’s electric car models . As the world is shifting towards electric mobility, the need for a suitable charging infrastructure network has never been more prevalent . As such, governments and cities across the globe are creating legislation and incentivizing the building of charging stations while more and more businesses are tapping into this new market. The number of publicly available charging stations is steadily increasing and will continue to do so to keep pace with the rapidly growing adoption of electric vehicles across the world. So in the future, as charging stations become more common fixtures on streets the world over, the locations you will be able to charge in will expand greatly. But what are the five most popular places to charge your car today? The five most popular car charging locations According to our Mobility Monitor report in partnership with Ipsos, in which we surveyed thousands of EV drivers (and potential EV drivers) across Europe, these are the five most popular places to charge an electric car: 1. Electric car charging at home With 64 percent of EV drivers charging regularly at their house, home EV charging takes the crown for the most popular charging location. This comes as no surprise, as charging at home enables electric car drivers to wake up to a fully charged vehicle every day and ensures they pay only for the electricity they consume at their household's electricity rate. 2. Electric car charging at work 34 percent of current EV drivers already regularly charge their car at the workplace, and many more have stated that they would love to be able to do so, and who wouldn’t? Driving to the office, focusing on your work during business hours, and driving home at the end of the day in a fully charged vehicle is undoubtedly convenient. As a result, more and more workplaces are starting to install EV charging stations as part of a sustainability initiative, employee engagement strategies, and to satisfy their EV-driving visitors and partners. 3. Public charging stations Each day, more public charging stations are popping up as cities and local governments are investing heavily in charging infrastructure. Today, 31 percent of EV drivers already use them regularly, and they are likely to play a crucial role in supporting electrification for city dwellers without access to a home charging station. 4. EV charging at gas stations Charging at home or at the office sounds nice, but what if you’re on the road and looking for a quick top-up? Many fuel retailers and service stations are starting to provide fast charging (also known as level 3 or DC charging ). 29 percent of current EV drivers already charge their car there regularly. While charging at the office or at home is convenient while you get on with your day, it can take hours to fully charge a battery, depending on the charging station’s power output. For times when you need a quick top-up, fast charging stations allow you to charge your battery in minutes, not hours, and be back on the road in no time. 5. Retail locations with electric car chargers 26 percent of EV drivers regularly charge their car at supermarkets, while 22 percent prefer shopping malls or department stores—if the service is available to them. Think of the convenience: imagine watching a movie, having dinner, meeting a friend for a coffee, or even doing some grocery shopping and returning to a vehicle with more charge than you left it with. More and more retail locations are discovering the growing need for this service and are installing charging stations to meet the demand and acquire new customers. 4. Different types of chargers EV charging levels and all types of chargers explained Charging can be categorized in multiple ways. The most common way to think about EV charging is in terms of charging levels. There are three levels of EV charging : Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3—and generally speaking, the higher the level, the higher the power output and the faster your new vehicle will charge. Generally speaking, the higher the level, the higher the power output and the faster your new vehicle will charge. However, in practice, charging times are influenced by many things like the car's battery, charging capacity, the charging station's power output. But also the battery temperature, how full your battery is when you start charging, and whether you’re sharing a charging station with another car or not can also influence the charging speed. The maximum charging capacity at a given level is determined either by your car’s charging capacity or the charging station’s power output, whichever is lower. Level 1 charger Level 1 charging simply refers to plugging your EV into a standard power socket. Depending on where you are in the world, a typical wall outlet only delivers a maximum of 2.3 kW, so charging via a Level 1 charger is the slowest way to charge an EV—giving only 6 to 8 kilometers of range per hour (4 to 5 miles). As there is no communication between the power outlet and the vehicle, this method is not only slow, but it can also be dangerous if handled improperly. As such, we don’t recommend relying on Level 1 charging to charge your vehicle except as a last resort. Level 2 charger A Level 2 charger is a dedicated charging station that you may find mounted to a wall, on a pole, or standing on the ground. Level 2 charging stations deliver alternating current (AC) and have a power output between 3.4 kW - 22 kW. They are commonly found at residential, public parking, businesses, and commercial locations and make up the majority of public EV chargers. At the maximum output of 22 kW, an hour’s charging will provide roughly 120 km (75 miles) to your battery’s range. Even lower power outputs of 7.4 kW and 11 kW will charge your EV much faster than Level 1 charging, adding 40 km (25 miles) and 60 km (37 miles) of range per hour respectively. Because of this reason, and thanks to a range of smart charging options , connectivity and safety features that Level 2 AC chargers offer, many EV drivers invest in an AC charging station for their home . Level 3 charging station (DC fast charger) Also known as DC or fast charging, Level 3 charging uses direct current (DC) to charge a vehicle’s battery directly, instead of the alternating current (AC) used by Level 1 and 2 charging stations. This allows Level 3 chargers to bypass an EV’s slower AC/DC onboard converter and deliver DC power directly to the battery. As a result, Level 3 charging stations can deliver much more power faster, making them ideal for short-stop locations like gas stations and fleet depots. Charging times vary between different vehicles and power outputs, however, generally speaking, Level 3 chargers can charge a vehicle in minutes versus hours for Level 2 or days for Level 1 charging stations. AC vs DC power So, the higher the level, the higher the charging speed. All clear so far, right? But what is AC and DC ? When is something AC and when DC, and why is DC so much faster? AC vs DC current AC stands for “Alternating Current”, and as its name implies, it changes direction periodically. DC stands for “Direct Current” and flows in a straight line. Without getting too technical, AC can be transported over long distances more efficiently, so this is why it flows out of your socket at your home and office. However, batteries are only able to store DC power , and electronics use DC to operate. You may have never realized it, but every time you charge your phone (or any other electrical device for that matter), the charger converts the AC power it receives from the grid into DC power to charge the battery in your device. How do electric cars charge? The same principle goes for electric cars. The difference between AC and DC charging all depends on whether there is a conversion process or not. No matter how you charge it though, at the end of the day, the electricity stored in the car’s battery is always DC. With a DC charger, power is converted from AC to DC by the charger, allowing direct current to flow straight into the battery. With an AC charger, the electricity has to be converted to DC by the car’s built-in converter before it can be fed into the battery. This process will always take longer as the onboard charger has a much more limited capacity than the external converters used in DC charging stations. 5. How long does it take to charge an electric car? What is the average time to charge an electric car and what affects charging speed? Once you’ve got your head around where to charge, what the different levels of charging are, and have a basic understanding of the difference between AC and DC, you can now better understand the answer to the number one question: “So how long will it take to charge my new EV?”. How long it takes precisely to charge an EV depends on different factors, such as your vehicle’s battery size, charging capacity, as well as a number of other situational factors. But, to give you an idea, here's a quick overview of average charging time estimates for a medium-sized EV. Level 1 (AC) About 19 hours Level 2 (AC) Between 1h 45 min - 6h Level 3 (DC) Between 17 min - 52 min To give you a somewhat accurate approximation, we’ve added an overview of how long it takes to charge EVs below. This overview looks at three average battery sizes and a few different charging power outputs. For a more detailed overview of a specific model, have a look at our electric car specifications page . Electric car charging times Type of EV Small EV Medium EV Large EV Average Battery Size (right) Power Output (Below) 40 kWh 65 kWh 90 kWh AC 2.3 kW 11h36m 18h50m 26h05m AC 7.4 kW 3h36m 5h51m 8h06m AC 11 kW 2h25m 3h56m 5h27m AC 22 kW 1h08m 1h45m 2h27m DC 50 kW 32 min 52 min 1h12m DC 1 0 0 kW 16 min 26 min 36 min DC 150 kW 17 min 24 min DC 240 kW 11 min 15 min DC 300 kW 8 min 11 min *Approximate time to charge the battery from 20 percent to 80 percent state of charge (SoC). For illustrative purposes only: Does not reflect exact charging times, some vehicles will not be able to handle certain power inputs and/or do not support fast charging. What affects charging speeds? Electric car battery The bigger the battery, the longer it will take to charge. Simple, right? An EV's battery capacity is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), similar to a liter or a gallon but for electricity, with each kWh equal to the amount of energy you would use to run a 1,000-watt appliance for an hour. The vast majority of electric passenger vehicle batteries today can hold somewhere between 25 and 100 kWh when fully charged, with the average EV having a 69 kWh battery capacity . Charging capacity of the vehicle The maximum power an EV can accept differs from vehicle to vehicle and can even vary depending on the model of the car. Measured in kilowatts (kW), the charging capacity is shown for both AC charging and DC charging, and each is a large factor in determining how long it takes to charge. For instance, if two vehicles with similar-sized batteries are charging side by side at a high-power DC charging station, but one can only accept 50 kW of DC power and the other 250 kW, then the latter will charge much faster than the former. Charging output of the charging station The different output of the charging station plays a large factor in how long it takes to charge an EV. The higher the kW output on a charging station, the faster it can charge (presuming that your vehicle can handle the higher power output). State of charge It might sound obvious, but how much charge you have in your vehicle when you begin your charging session also plays a part in how long it takes to charge. The same as when you’re putting gas in a traditional vehicle, depending on whether you have half a tank or are almost empty, how long it takes to charge will differ. The DC charging curve With AC charging, the power flow from the charger to an EV is mostly flat, meaning that it will charge at roughly the same speed from 0-100 percent full. In contrast, with DC charging, the EV’s battery initially accepts a very high flow of power, then quickly peaks and starts to decrease the power it takes in as it begins to fill up. The reason for this pattern is twofold. You might remember from above that with AC charging, the conversion from AC to DC happens inside the vehicle by the onboard converter. This has a fairly limited power capacity, which is quickly reached and can be sustained throughout the whole charging session. DC charging, on the other hand, unlocks much greater power output, so it needs to adjust this as the session progresses to avoid damaging the battery. Because of their chemistry, EV batteries can take in much higher power at low states of charge, and this ability decreases progressively as they get closer to full. As a result, with a DC or Level 3 charger, the initial phase of charging (to 80 percent full) is much faster than the last 20 percent (which may take roughly the same amount of time as the first 80 percent). Weather conditions Another factor that will determine charging times is the weather. As batteries operate more efficiently in temperate weather—roughly between 20–25°C (68-77°F)—it will take longer to charge a vehicle in colder or extremely warm weather. 6. How much does it cost to charge an electric car? Cost to charge electric car Just like with how long it takes to charge an EV, the cost of charging depends on multiple variables including where you charge it, or the type of vehicle you drive. Before we get into it in greater detail, here are the approximate costs of charging four different size vehicles (with battery packs from small to large), at three different types of charging stations, so that you can get a ballpark idea of charging costs for your new EV. Average cost to charge electric car Vehicle type Battery size Home charging cost per kWh: $0.15 Public / workplace charging cost per kWh: $0.35 + $1 charging fee Fast charging cost per kWh: $0.50 + $2 charging fee Fiat 500e 42 kWh $6.30 $15.70 $27.20 Volkswagen ID4 55 kWh $8.25 $20.25 $35.00 Hyundai IONIQ 5 77.4 kWh $11.61 $28.09 $48.44 Tesla Model 3 82 kWh $12.30 $29.70 $51.20 Important: Prices for each charging segment are approximations based on our experience and do not represent a real-life situation. These calculations are based on a median guesstimate charging tariff and represent the cost to charge from zero to 100 percent. Size of the electric car battery The first thing you need to know when calculating how much it costs to charge your EV is the size of your battery. As shown above, the larger the battery, the more kWhs it can store; the more kWhs it can store, the more power it takes to fill the battery; the more power it takes, the more you have to pay to fill your battery. Simple, right? Vehicles with a larger battery cost more to charge, but can often drive further on a single charge too. For instance, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with an 82 kWh battery costs about $12.30 to fully charge at home but has a range of roughly 614 km (381 miles). However, a Fiat 500e with a much smaller 42 kWh battery, while costing a fraction of the price to charge, only has a 321 km (200 miles) range. Once you know how big your new EV’s battery is (measured in kWh), you can approximate how much it costs to charge at different charging stations. The three main options are at home, at public locations, or at fast-charging stations. EV home charging cost Charging from home is the cheapest way to charge your new car. Because there’s no middle man standing in between you and the cost of energy, you’ll always get the cheapest rate available to consumers at home. Electric car electric bill How much it costs to charge at home is an easy equation. Simply take your latest energy bill and find the price per kWh you pay at home and multiply it by the size of your battery. On average, residential prices for electricity vary from around €/$0.10 on the low end in Europe and North America to €/$0.32 on the higher end. At the time of writing this guide, we’ve taken some averages around the world from Energybot (US), the European Union (EU), and Nimblefins (UK): United States : $ 0.15 per kWh European Union : € 0.28 per kWh United Kingdom : £ 0.33 per kWh That means if you’ve just bought a Tesla Model 3 with an 82 kWh battery and pay $0.15 for electricity, you’ll be set back around $12.30 to fully charge your EV. While this calculation gives an estimation of home charging costs, it doesn’t take into account the battery’s current state of charge, the state of your battery in general, weather conditions, or the type of charger, which can all impact your actual costs. Cost of charging electric car at public station Public charging stations can range from offices to curbside stations and commercial parking garages to shopping malls, restaurants, and hotels. The truth is that today, there’s no shortage of businesses big and small investing in EV charging. At the same time, cities and governments are investing in EV charging infrastructure to accelerate the shift towards sustainable mobility. When you put both together, you’ve got charging stations springing up in a range of locations. Public charging stations can be either Level 2 or Level 3 (AC or DC charging stations) stations but, for simplicity, we’ve split them into two categories and will discuss them separately as they usually come with very different costs. In both cases, public charging has a middleman providing the service (called charge point operators), so public charging stations usually have a marked-up price in comparison to home charging. How much it costs to charge depends on the base price of electricity in your location and how much the provider charges you for the service. In some cases, like workplaces and offices, the provider is also an employer and will provide EV charging as an employee benefit and may charge less, or even allow employees to charge for free. Others, like parking facilities and shopping malls, will take the price of electricity and mark it up to make a profit on it, like any other service they offer. Some, like restaurants and hotels, may use EV charging as a way to attract new customers and offer free or discounted charging to patrons. Just like the diversity in how much it costs, how these providers will calculate costs also differs greatly. Below is a list of the four most common ways to calculate charging tariffs. Connection fee: a fixed amount for each session. Energy fee: a certain price per kWh used during the charging session. Time fee: Cost per minute or hour. Service fee: A one-off markup for providing the service. For example, a charging provider might charge $0.35 per kWh with a $1 service fee, meaning it would cost you $29.70 to fully charge a Tesla Model 3 with an 82 kWh battery. How much it costs in practice for you depends on the provider, your country and region. While public charging tends to be more expensive, it is often faster than charging at home, and still cheaper than gas. Cost to charge electric car at a DC fast charger Level 3 or DC charging is the fastest way to charge an EV. Depending on the power output and your vehicle’s fast charging capabilities, it will likely take somewhere between 15 minutes and an hour to charge your EV up to 80 percent full. These speeds make DC charging stations perfect for quick top-ups at on-the-go locations like highway rest stops, gas stations, or supermarkets. However, DC charging stations are also the most expensive to build and run. To enable these charging times, DC charging stations have to deliver serious amounts of power to a vehicle’s battery—think between 50 and 350 kW rather than 22 kW, the maximum output for AC charging stations. As a result of these high installation and operating costs, charging service providers will often ask for a much higher price to pass on some of their expenses to the customer. In some cases, DC fast charging stations can cost double, or even triple, the kWh price of electricity—making the costs here similar to the cost of filling up your tank with fossil fuels. Typical costs can range from $0.60 per kWh with a $2 service fee to a flat rate of $0.99 per minute. This means that to fully charge the same Tesla Model 3 as above, it would be closer to $50 for a full battery. But where filling up your tank at the gas station is the only option for ICE vehicles, DC fast charging is more of a sporadic convenience on long trips than an everyday tool for your daily commute. Cost of electric car vs. gas One of the questions we hear potential EV drivers ask us all the time is, are EVs cheaper to charge than filling up a conventional fossil-fuel vehicle? As you may have guessed by now, the answer to that question is almost always yes. Regardless of charging costs for individual sessions, when you take into account that most EV drivers charge at home, occasionally topping up when shopping or at the workplace, and using fast charging for long-distance journeys, EV charging is usually a lot cheaper than filling a car with gasoline or diesel . 7. How far can an electric car go? Electric car range Another question many potential EV drivers want to know before buying an EV is, “how far will I be able to drive with my new car?” Or should we say, the real question on everyone’s mind is, “Am I going to run out of charge on a long-distance journey?” This concern is understandable; charging a battery is one of the main differences with driving an ICE vehicle and a question on many people’s minds. In the early days of electric mobility, range anxiety gripped many potential EV drivers. And not without reason: Ten years ago, the best-selling EV, the Nissan LEAF, had a maximum range of only 175 km (109 miles). Today, the average range of EVs is nearly more than double that at 348 km (216 miles), and many EVs have a range of above 500 km (300 miles); plenty for even the longer daily urban commutes. This increase in range, together with the rapid development of charging infrastructure, means range anxiety is becoming increasingly unwarranted. But what about long trips? Even EVs with the furthest range may still need to stop and charge on a long journey. This is where DC fast charging stations come in – with their high power, they can quickly top up your battery while you stop to eat, stretch your legs, or take a bathroom break. And while it depends on where you live, fast charging infrastructure is growing rapidly and is already widely accessible across the US, UK, EU, and China. Should I charge my electric car every night? Most EV drivers won’t even have to charge their car daily. Did you know that in the US, the average American drives roughly 62 km (39 miles) a day and in Europe, the daily kilometers driven by car are on average, less than half of what they drive in the US ? The bottom line is that most of our daily commutes won’t even come close to reaching an EV's maximum range, regardless of the make or model, and even back in 2010. For a more detailed overview of the range of any specific model, you can have a look at our electric car specifications page . 8. How long do electric car batteries last? Car battery life An EV’s battery is by far the most expensive component of the car, so it’s only understandable that you want to know how long your new EV’s battery will last . Just like all lithium-ion batteries, EV batteries will slowly lose some of their capacity over time. However, unlike the battery in your phone or laptop, EV batteries are designed with heavy use in mind and last for years under normal use. Rather than just stopping altogether, which is unlikely, a battery will gradually lose capacity with an average decline across all electric vehicles at around 2.3 percent per year. That means that if you purchase an EV today with a 240 km (150 miles) range, after five years, the battery will have lost 27 km (17 miles) of accessible range. Most EV manufacturers will also give between 8-10 years warranty on their battery, or up to 100,000 km (62,000 miles). How long should a car battery last? According to current estimates, EV batteries have a projected lifespan of about 15 to 20 years or around 100,000 to 200,000 miles on the road . This is longer than the current average life expectancy of a car, which is approximately 12 years, so EV batteries will, in most cases, outlive the vehicle they’re in. There are also a few simple habits you can adopt to maximize your EV’s battery life, such as only charging up to 80 percent for everyday driving and avoiding letting your car’s battery get close to empty. 9. EV charging cables and charger plugs EV charging connector types explained Many of the sections above have answered questions you may or may not have had before purchasing your new EV. However, we can take a guess that you probably haven’t even thought about charging cables and plugs, the world of EV cables and plugs is as diverse as it is complex. As different regions adopted EVs simultaneously, each developed its own cables and plugs, and there’s still no universal standard for charging to this day. As a result, just like Apple has one charging port and Samsung has another, many different EV manufacturers and countries use different charging technologies. To get a detailed overview of a specific model, our electric car specifications page shows the type of plug types and other specifications per car. Broadly speaking, the two main ways EV charging can differ are the cable connecting the car to the charging station or wall outlet and the type of plug used to connect the vehicle to the charging station. EV cables Charging cables come in four modes. While each is most commonly used with a specific type of charging, these modes do not necessarily always correlate to the “level” of charging . Mode 1 Mode 1 charging cables are used to connect light electric vehicles like e-bikes and scooters to a standard wall outlet and cannot be used to charge EVs. Their lack of communication between the vehicle and the charging point, as well as their limited power capacity, make them unsafe for EV charging. Mode 2 When you purchase an EV, it will typically come with what’s known as a Mode 2 charging cable. This type of cable allows you to connect your EV to a standard household outlet and use it to charge your vehicle with a maximum power output of around 2.3 kW. Mode 2 charging cables feature an In-Cable Control and Protection Device (IC-CPD) which manages the charging process and makes this cable much safer than Mode 1. Mode 3 A Mode 3 charging cable connects your vehicle to a dedicated EV charging station and is considered to be the most common for AC charging. Mode 3 cables can either be built into a charging station or removable – in fact, many EV manufacturers will provide a Mode 3 cable with their new cars to enable public charging. Mode 4 Mode 4 charging cables are used when fast charging. These cables are designed to transfer the higher power from DC (level 3) charging , must be connected to a charging station, and are often even liquid-cooled to deal with the heat. EV charging plug types (AC) The charging plug is a connector that you insert into the charging socket of an electric car. These plugs can differ based on power output, the make of the vehicle, and the country the car was manufactured in. You’ll find that EV charging plugs can be mostly broken down by region and whether they’re used for AC or DC fast charging . For example, the EU primarily uses Type 2 connectors for AC charging, while the US uses CCS1 for DC fast charging. AC charging plugs Plug type Design Power output* Locations Type 1 Up to 7.4 kW Japan and North America Type 2 Up to 22 kW for private charging Up to 43 kW for public charging Europe and the rest of the world GB/T Up to 27.7 kW China *These numbers represent the maximum power output that a plug can deliver at the time of writing this article. The numbers do not reflect actual power outputs as this is also dependent on the charging station, charging cable, and the receptive vehicle. EV charging plug types (DC) DC charging plugs Plug Type Design Power output* Locations CCS1 Up to 350 kW North America CCS2 Up to 350 kW Europe CHAdeMO Up to 200 kW Japan GB/T Up to 250 kW China *These numbers represent the maximum power output that a plug can deliver at the time of writing this article. The numbers do not reflect actual power outputs as this is also dependent on the charging station, charging cable, and the receptive vehicle. What about the Tesla charging plug? There is one exception to the charging plugs presented above, and that’s Tesla’s proprietary charging plug used by the company for its North American vehicles. Recently, Tesla opened up its charging plug for other manufacturers to adopt, now called the North American Charging Standard (NACS) . This will mean that the existing Type 1 and NACS will likely coexist for a while in the American market, and time will tell which – and whether – one will come out on top. Looking for more?

Manufacturer recommends a lower battery charge level for daily use to preserve battery life. What is EPA estimated range? In short, this is the approximate number of miles that a vehicle can travel in combined city and highway driving (using a mix of 55% highway and 45% city driving) before needing to be recharged, according to the EPA's testing methodology. But what exactly is that methodology? First, the vehicle is fully charged and parked overnight. The following day, the vehicle is driven on a dynamometer — it's like a treadmill for cars — over successive simulated city and highway routes until the battery is depleted. The total distance traveled is then multiplied by a correction factor that the EPA has determined will more accurately reflect what drivers can expect to achieve in the real world. The value of this correction factor, which is always less than 1 but greater than 0, is determined by the number of drive cycles a vehicle is tested on. In short, there's certainly a method to the EPA's madness, but the process is laboratory-based, and EV owners don't drive their cars in a lab. So what's the real-world version? That's where Edmunds' EV range testing comes in. What is EPA estimated consumption? Akin to miles per gallon (mpg) for fuel-burning vehicles, this metric represents electric vehicles' energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per hundred miles (kWh/100 miles). A battery stores energy in kilowatt-hours much like a gas tank stores fuel in gallons. This value tells you how much energy in kilowatt-hours a vehicle would use to travel 100 miles. Unlike mpg, however, where a larger number is better (for example, a vehicle that gets 30 mpg is better than one that gets 20 mpg), a smaller number is better in kWh/100 miles because you are using less battery energy per mile. So a vehicle that uses 20 kWh/100 miles is more efficient than one that uses 30 kWh/100 miles. In EPA testing, once a vehicle battery is depleted, it is recharged using the manufacturer-supplied charger for that vehicle. The energy consumption is then determined mathematically from the recharging energy, the energy-discharge data from the vehicle, and the distance traveled for each cycle. The recharge energy includes any charging losses due to inefficiencies in the manufacturer’s charger. What is Edmunds tested range? Edmunds begins with full battery charge and drives an electric vehicle on a mix of city and highway roads (approximately 60% city, 40% highway) until the battery is almost entirely empty. (We target 10 miles of remaining range for safety.) The miles traveled and the indicated remaining range are added together for the Edmunds total tested range figure. We prefer to use a higher percentage of city road driving because we believe it's more representative of typical EV use. What is Edmunds tested consumption? After a vehicle completes its road loop and the battery is nearly empty, it's charged back to full capacity. The kilowatt-hours used from plug-in to a full charge are tracked and then we calculate the consumption based on the miles traveled (less the remaining range). This process takes into account charging losses in the Edmunds tested consumption number. What is Range % difference EPA vs. Edmunds? This figure is the difference between the EPA's range estimate and the range tested in Edmunds' real-world testing. A positive percentage (in green) means Edmunds exceeded the range estimated by the EPA, while a negative percentage (in red) means a vehicle fell short of its EPA range during our test. What is Consumption % difference EPA vs. Edmunds? This figure is the difference between the EPA's energy consumption estimate and the energy consumption Edmunds calculated based on our real-world testing. A positive percentage (in green) means a vehicle used that much less energy than its EPA estimate and was more efficient in Edmunds' testing. A negative percentage (in red) means a vehicle used that much more energy than its EPA estimate and was less efficient in Edmunds' testing. Remember, a lower kWh/100 miles number is better if you're talking EVs. What is ambient temperature and why does it matter? Ambient temperature — how cold or hot it is outside — matters a whole lot when it comes to electric vehicle range, so we list the daily average temperature on the day of testing. California, and more specifically Los Angeles, has one of the more temperate climates in the world, which helps keep our testing conditions relatively consistent throughout the year. But since we can't control the weather, we thought we'd at least report it. How does Edmunds conduct its testing? The roads Edmunds drives on specific road routes that cover both highway and city driving around the greater Los Angeles area. We aim for a mix of 60% city driving and 40% highway, assuming that most electric vehicle owners will likely spend more time in stop-and-go traffic than they will on the open highway. Since no electric vehicle has exactly the same range, the route length is adapted to suit each vehicle. The methodology In EPA tests, a vehicle is run in the default settings at startup. If there are more efficient drive modes available, or if you can increase the level of regenerative braking, but the vehicle doesn't default to these settings, they won't be utilized. Edmunds' standard practice is to use the most efficient drive mode as long as it doesn't affect safety or practical comfort levels, such as deactivating the climate control system or significantly reducing power for accelerating or maintaining appropriate highway speeds. We run with windows up and the climate control set to auto at 72 degrees, and we maximize regenerative braking during stops. We follow the posted speed limits and keep within 5 mph of them, traffic and conditions permitting. Which number is more accurate, EPA or Edmunds? The short answer is neither. So many factors contribute to how far an electric vehicle will travel on a single charge that to come up with a single figure for every situation is impossible. The EPA's testing is highly controlled and standardized, but as we've found in our testing, the real-world correlation can vary dramatically depending on the vehicle. Because Edmunds' testing uses a more conservative driving style and puts greater emphasis on city driving over highway driving (compared to the EPA's mix), our figures will often be on the higher end for range, which usually equates to better efficiency. But that's not always the case. Overall, our figures are intended to provide EV owners and potential customers with an additional data point so that they can make more informed decisions. † To date, every Tesla vehicle we've run on our real-world test route has failed to hit its EPA range estimate within the testing parameters described above, whereas most non-Tesla vehicles have surpassed their EPA estimates.
